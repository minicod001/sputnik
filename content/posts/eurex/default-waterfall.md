In case of the {{< color red >}}default of a Clearing Member{{< /color >}}, Eurex Clearing primarily uses:
- the financial resources provided by such defaulted Clearing Member (i.e. its margin collateral and its contribution to the Default Fund)

If such resources are insufficient to cover all losses: 
- Eurex Clearing’s own contribution to the default waterfall, the so-called {{< color blue >}}_dedicated amount_{{< /color >}} is employed

If such resources are still insufficient to cover all remaining losses: 
- non-defaulted Clearing Members’ contributions to the Default Fund are applied

If such resources are insufficient to cover all remaining losses: 
- Clearing Members are required to provide Eurex Clearing with additional financial resources, so-called {{< color blue >}}_assessments_{{< /color >}} 
- Eurex Clearing provides additional financial resources as well, the so-called {{< color blue >}}_further dedicated amount_{{< /color >}}

If such resources are still insufficient to cover all remaining losses: 
- finally, Eurex Clearing’s equity capital is applied to cover any remaining losses. 
- in addition, Deutsche Börse AG has issued a {{< color blue >}}letter of comfort{{< /color >}} in favour of Eurex Clearing, according to which Deutsche Börse AG will provide Eurex Clearing with financial funding to enable Eurex Clearing to comply with its obligations.
