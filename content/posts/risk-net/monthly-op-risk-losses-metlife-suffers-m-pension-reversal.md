The biggest operational risk loss in February was incurred by US insurer MetLife, which reinstated [$510 million](http://services.corporate-ir.net/SEC.Enhanced/SecCapsule.aspx?c=121171&fid=15445713) of pension reserves it had previously released in the 1990s. The firm discovered it had failed to make appropriate efforts to locate almost 13,500 people before declaring them “unresponsive and missing” and releasing their funds from its reserves. As a result, annuitants failed to receive due payments over a 25-year period.

Its internal controls at the time meant MetLife would release funds after only two unsuccessful attempts to contact pension holders, once at age 65 and once at age 70. Following the admission, MetLife made changes to its procedures. For example, it has now pledged to make multiple attempts to contact pensioners and to conduct additional data checks before releasing funds.

The deficiencies and remedial action came to light in an 8-K filing the insurer lodged with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

In the second biggest loss, Vanquis, the credit card subsidiary of UK’s Provident Financial, reached a [£170.8 million](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-vanquis-1976000-and-orders-vanquis-pay-compensation-customers) ($239 million) settlement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority over its failure to disclose the full price of an add-on product it sold. According to the regulator, Vanquis informed customers how the product worked and what the monthly charge was, but did not tell customers that the product attracted interest if there was an unpaid balance on a customer’s card at the end of the month. The regulator imposed a penalty of £2 million on Vanquis, and the firm will refund £168.8 million to affected customers.

In third place, another cryptocurrency exchange suffered a large-scale hack. Following the theft of NEM coins from Japanese exchange Coincheck in January, last month 17 million Nano coins worth up to [$270 million](https://bitgrail.com/news) were stolen from BitGrail, an exchange based in Italy. BitGrail’s owner claimed the theft was due to a coding flaw in Nano coins, which left the cryptocurrency vulnerable to a hack. The coin’s developers refuted these allegations, leaving the attack’s causes unclear.

In the fourth biggest loss, US peer-to-peer lender LendingClub agreed to pay [$125 million](http://ir.lendingclub.com/file.aspx?IID=4213397&FID=392262879) to settle class action claims it misled investors about its compliance practices. Shareholders alleged that LendingClub misrepresented its internal controls as adequate to ensure loans met investors’ criteria. The claimants are seeking to recover losses incurred when LendingClub’s share price tumbled in 2016. The fall occurred when the firm admitted governance failings relating to ousted chief Renaud Laplanche and the improper sale of $22 million of low-quality loans to an institutional investor earlier that year.

Finally, Indian Overseas Bank has suffered alleged losses of [7.71 billion rupees](http://cbi.nic.in/pressreleases/pr_2018-02-19-1.php) ($119.4 million) on fraudulent loans made to a Kanpur-based stationery company, dating back to 2008. The losses came to light on February 18, when India’s Central Bureau of Investigation published a report on the fraud, accusing Vikram Kothari, director of Rotomac Pens, of “misappropriation of funds, criminal breach of trust and violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act”. Six other Indian banks are implicated in the fraud for a total of around $550 million: Allahabad Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, Oriental Bank of Commerce, and Union Bank of India. According to local press reports, Kothari represented that the money would be used for the procurement of goods, but it was actually diverted to a sham company and funnelled back to Rotomac.

### Story spotlight: Punjab National Bank hit by data breach

Along with uncovering a $2 billion fraud in February, Punjab National Bank faced an additional challenge after it discovered that the credit and debit card information of over 10,000 of its customers was for sale on the dark web at $4.50 per card.

According to [Cloudsek](https://www.cloudsek.com/announcements/press/press-release-pnb-bank-cc-breach/), the security firm that uncovered the breach, the information had been available to purchase for at least three months. The security firm’s initial attempt to contact PNB was frustrated when the email it sent to the cyber-crime contact address listed on the bank’s website bounced back. PNB is still investigating how the details ended up on the dark web.

### In focus: Outsourcing risk

‘Outsourcing risk,’ ‘third-party risk,’ or ‘vendor risk’. Firms may disagree over how to label the potential vulnerabilities introduced to their organisation through external suppliers, but they are unanimous on the potential damage caused by this threat.

When outsourcing, firms put their trust in third parties to perform activities on their behalf. This brings reputational, regulatory and economic risks, making the need for strong governance and oversight key.

ORX News has recorded almost 100 operational risk events related to outsourcing in the past decade. The recorded costs of fines and settlements related to these events are over $1.1 billion, but reputational costs are likely to be much higher.

Firms must put their trust in these third parties to provide these services to the same level the firm itself would have done, or better. With a firm’s reputation on the line, as well as exposure to regulatory or economic loss risk, they need to have strong governance in place. Oversight is key.

An ongoing ORX research study on outsourcing risk recently surveyed more than 50 firms worldwide on their practices. The majority of firms stated their outsourcing activity was increasing, as was their operational risk function’s oversight of the process.

With a greater number of suppliers and growing demand for second-line oversight, the mature state of vendor risk management is a target that is always moving. [Data management](https://www.risk.net/5423326?utm_source=article&utm_medium=risk.net&utm_campaign=Top10oprisk189), [cyber concerns](https://www.risk.net/5423331?utm_source=article&utm_medium=risk.net&utm_campaign=Top10oprisk188) and reliability of contingency plans rank the highest in the considerations of firms over their vendor arrangements. This raises the question of whether the perceived savings or efficiency gains from outsourcing tasks to suppliers are actually being realised, if the internal resources dedicated to measuring, managing and monitoring a firm’s vendor portfolio are significant.

Market participants ranked outsourcing risk as the [fifth most important operational risk](https://www.risk.net/5423361?utm_source=article&utm_medium=risk.net&utm_campaign=Top10oprisk187) affecting their firm in the year ahead, down from third place the previous year, according to Risk.net’s annual roundup of the top 10 op risks.
