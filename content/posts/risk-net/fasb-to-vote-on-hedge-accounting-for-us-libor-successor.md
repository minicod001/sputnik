> _Standards body likely to approve SOFR as eligible_

The US Financial Accounting Standards Board is set to vote on whether to designate the US dollar Libor replacement – the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) – as eligible for hedge accounting, according to a source familiar with the matter.

The vote is likely to pass, as the FASB stated in August it was “prepared to add to the list of eligible benchmark rates as necessary when those rates emerge” and the list of rates available for hedge accounting treatment already includes the Libor swap rate. The other eligible rates are US Treasury rates, the overnight index swap rate and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association municipal swap rate.

“The board indicated that it is ready to work on including the new benchmark rate, which will be decided at the board meeting,” the source says. The meeting is currently scheduled for December 20.

“If the board decides to add this new rate, then a consultation paper will be issued. Once public comments have been considered, the FASB will then confirm or withdraw the decision. If confirmed, final guidance will be issued meaning the rate is available for hedge accounting,” the source says.

Hedge accounting allows the change in the value of a financial instrument, such as a mortgage, to be offset by the change in the value of the corresponding hedge. In this way, banks and other companies are able to avoid profit-and-loss volatility created when the securities they hold are marked to market.

Libor swaps are often designated as hedges for the interest rate risk in a host of bonds and loans but, with Libor’s future in question, SOFR will need to be added to the FASB’s list so that swaps linked to the new rate can qualify for the hedge accounting treatment.

Libor is likely to be phased out after 2021 as banks will no longer be compelled to submit quotes for it after that date. [SOFR](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5320981/libors-sunset-sees-us-repo-market-cast-a-longer-shadow) was picked as US Libor’s replacement for derivatives contracts by an industry working group, convened by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, earlier this year. Publication of the new rate is set to begin in the first half of 2018.

Antonio Corbi, risk and capital specialist at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, sees SOFR’s eligibility for hedge accounting as a crucial step towards a broad-based adoption of the new rate.

“The FASB is being proactive in supporting the industry’s transition from Libor to a new secured rate that can be utilised as an alternative benchmark rate. Isda is already working on the accounting impact and we see the FASB’s involvement as a critical milestone on the path to a successful transition from US dollar Libor to SOFR,” he says.

But questions remain around the practical implications of a switch away from Libor in [legacy](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5356091/the-fraught-search-for-a-libor-fallback) hedging positions. A key one is: will transitioning the contracts on to a new rate make them new trades, which would break the existing hedge accounting relationships?

Dan Gentzel, senior accounting adviser at consultancy Chatham Financial, says: “If the FASB doesn’t include an amendment to allow a change from Libor to SOFR as not a [material] change in the terms of a swap, then companies are going to have to take a look at all their hedging relationships with Libor swaps and possibly have to re-designate them once that rate changes.” Re-designation, or documenting the newly transitioned trades as hedges for specific instruments, could be burdensome for firms.

Companies will run into another problem if SOFR is applied to the loans and bonds they have hedged.

“If companies have not considered that the rate might be tied to SOFR, then they would have to consider changing the rate on their hedging relationship,” Gentzel says. “The impact could be having to end an existing hedging relationship and create a brand-new one. This could lead to … some complexities in applying hedge accounting on an ongoing basis.”

The Fed-backed group, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, plans to explore transition to SOFR for cash products as well as derivatives next year and is inviting firms and associations active in loans, floating-rate notes and securitisations to take part in the process.
