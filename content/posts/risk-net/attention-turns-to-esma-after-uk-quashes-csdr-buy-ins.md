> _Esma launched informal review just before UK Treasury opted out of settlement regime_

The European Union could face renewed pressure to rethink its pending rules on settlement discipline following the UK government’s unilateral decision to opt out of the regime, which is due to go into effect in February 2021.

The settlement discipline regime is set out in Article 7 of the EU’s central securities depositories regulation (CSDR), which requires that if one party to a trade fails to deliver securities, a third-party agent [must be contracted to buy in the missing securities](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7541121/csdr-buy-ins-next-on-the-regulatory-chopping-block) to ensure delivery to the receiving party.

“Mandatory buy-ins have been subject to an awful lot of criticism from industry,” says Steven Burrows, a financial regulatory lawyer at Fieldfisher. “Hopefully, the fact that the UK has already broken off and said ‘we are not going to bother with this’ might give the EU the impetus to revisit some aspects of this somewhere down the line.”

As part of its withdrawal agreement, the UK must abide by any EU financial regulation in force before December 31, 2020. Since the settlement discipline rules have yet to take effect, the UK retained the option of cancelling them.

“The UK will not be implementing the EU’s new settlement discipline regime, set out in the CSDR, which is due to apply in February 2021. UK firms should instead continue to apply the existing industry-led framework,” chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak said in a [statement](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2020-06-23/HCWS309/) to the House of Commons on June 23.

The move came a week after the European Securities and Markets Authority circulated a non-public review document to national competent authorities and industry bodies covering all aspects of CSDR, according to one source familiar with the document. The UK’s decision is likely to feature in responses to that review, putting further pressure on Esma to act.

Critics of mandatory buy-ins argue they could drive up costs for the delivering party in a trade, forcing them to reconsider the risks involved before entering each trade. A survey by the International Capital Market Association (Icma) published in November 2019 [found](https://www.icmagroup.org/assets/documents/Regulatory/Secondary-markets/CSDR-Settlement-Regulation/Mandatory-buy-ins-under-CSDR-and-the-European-bond-markets-Impact-Study-271119.pdf) that a majority of participants planned to respond to the introduction of mandatory buy-ins by increasing their pricing or even scaling back their activity in the markets most likely to be affected.

Those concerns are most acute when entering into repurchase agreements (repos) and securities lending transactions in less-liquid instruments – such as corporate and emerging market bonds, or small- and mid-cap equities – where the risk of a settlement failure is highest.

“I get the impression the UK would like to be as aligned as possible in terms of the EU settlement discipline regime,” says Andy Hill, a senior director of market practice and regulatory policy at Icma. “It is just that the mandatory buy-in piece is not fit for purpose, so why would a third-country ever take it on?”

### Crest of a wave?

The UK’s opt-out is limited in scope. The CSDR applies to individual CSDs, not to specific counterparties. As a result, all trades settled at EU CSDs will still be subject to the rules from February next year, even if they are executed by UK or other non-EU entities.

Sunak’s announcement means mandatory buy-ins will not be required at the UK settlement system, Crest, which is operated by Euroclear and mainly settles UK-listed equities and UK Treasury gilts.

Although Crest is a substantial CSD – reflecting the size of UK financial markets – it accounted for less than a quarter of total European CSD trade volumes in 2018, according to data from the European Central Bank (see figure 1). Its share of volumes will dip somewhat this year as Euroclear migrates the settlement of Irish corporate securities from its UK subsidiary into Euroclear Bank in Belgium, in response to Brexit.

The majority of securities transactions in Europe are settled by the EU-regulated operations of Euroclear and Deutsche Börse-owned Clearstream.

“When you dig into it, what it means for banks like us – multi-jurisdictional and cross-border – does it mean you put the pen down on the project?” says a market structure expert at a large UK bank. “The answer is no, and you could argue things could become more complicated, with different jurisdictional nuances you need to work through. For instance, with somebody sitting in the UK trading with someone in the EU in a dollar product – what does that look like?”

Some argue the UK’s decision could boost Crest if market participants view it as a lower-risk venue for settlement than EU CSDs still subject to mandatory buy-ins.

Iain Mackay, head of post-trade services at EquiLend – a trading platform for securities lending – says this prospect was discussed even before Sunak’s statement, specifically with regard to dollar-denominated instruments. Some were already expecting to see better pricing and liquidity for the same dollar instruments settled at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation in the US after February 2021 than at the international CSDs in the EU.

“Now Crest will potentially come into this, versus settling in Euroclear or Clearstream. No-one knows specific answers to this, but this is a potential impact,” says Mackay.

Others point out that the process of migrating settlement between CSDs is not always straightforward. In many cases, settlement is closely linked to the regulated market on which the instruments are listed, resulting in silos of national CSDs. Euroclear and Clearstream have built market share because they operate the dominant CSDs in several different EU markets.

“Effectively, you have a fragmentation across the EU – each member state has one or more major CSDs that are responsible for settling products local to that member state,” says Burrows.

### Settle down

As a result, the market structure expert at the UK bank does not expect to see a dramatic shift in settlement activity immediately after the rules take effect.

“It is possible to move things around, but it has to be balanced against what our customers want to do,” he says. “I think you will see a change, but I don’t think it would be a big bang on day one. Banks and other parties will implement the regulation in the affected jurisdictions, and it is possible over time that the market starts to operate differently.”

But even the prospect of a gradual shift in liquidity could strengthen the industry’s ongoing lobbying efforts for an EU rethink on mandatory buy-ins.

In a letter written by Esma chair Steven Maijoor to industry bodies on April 16, he stated categorically that buy-ins [would not be reviewed](https://www.icmagroup.org/assets/documents/Regulatory/Secondary-markets/CSDR-Settlement-Regulation/ESMA70-156-2456-Response-Chair-to-AFME-ICMA-22-01-2020-CSDR-Settlement-Discipline-170420.pdf) until after February 2021.

“It is premature to consider further action at this point in time, in the absence of concrete evidence following the implementation of the buy-in requirements. Esma is committed to monitoring the situation and will assess the need for any further action following the implementation of the settlement discipline regime,” Maijoor wrote.

However, one source takes heart from the fact that Esma’s private review document solicits feedback on all aspects of CSDR, including Article 7. This could be interpreted as a softening of tone compared with the April 16 letter.

Esma has asked for responses to the review by July 10 – a tight timetable that suggests a desire to act relatively quickly on any significant findings.

“We don’t want to read too much into it, but we wonder if this is Esma and the European Commission thinking they do need to change something before February,” says the source.

Esma did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
