> _Recent advances in behavioural finance could give rise to new quant models and strategies_

To understand why investors make mistakes, Cary Frydman once put traders and portfolio managers in a brain scanner.

As they made investment decisions, Frydman, an associate professor at the USC Marshall School of Business, noticed that when the stocks they sold subsequently went up, an area of the brain associated with regret began to switch on. The bigger the price increase, the bigger the signal – and the investors that experienced the most regret made the [biggest mistakes](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/29/11/3108/2583663). Their wounded pride led them to stay out of a rising market.

Frydman is one of a group of academics trying to pin down exactly how cognitive bias shapes investor behaviour – often using experiments like this one. “There has been a huge uptick in laboratory experimenting in finance,” he says. “Behavioural finance has become more mainstream, and lab experiments offer invaluable testbeds for its theories.”

This line of research builds on the work of pioneers such as Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky and Richard Thaler, who created the fields of behavioural economics and finance and popularised it in books such as Kahneman’s Thinking fast and slow and Thaler’s The winner’s curse.

Kahneman and Thaler both won Nobel prizes – the former for his work on prospect theory, which revealed that people dislike losses more than they like gains, and will go to great lengths to avoid big losses, even if they are unlikely.

But this body of research has been of limited practical use to investors – especially quant investors. Cognitive biases have been useful in explaining why some existing investment strategies work – but not so much for discovering new ones. The new studies have the potential to change that by unearthing the inner mechanics of cognitive biases – the cogs that drive the wheels of flawed reasoning. The findings could give rise to novel investment strategies and even form the backbone of a new class of quant models.

“The list of behavioural biases is known,” says Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, chairman of systematic investing firm Capital Fund Management, which has sponsored some of this experimental research. “What’s not known is whether it’s an exhaustive list, whether some biases are redundant, how they interfere with one another, how they can be confounded, what they are conditional on. We want to come up with more than just qualitative characterisations for these biases. We want to put numbers in front of them.”

### Quirky behaviour

The current understanding of behavioural biases in investing is dominated by three [core ideas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352239918300010): over-extrapolation, reference points and overconfidence.

Over-extrapolation leads investors to treat past performance as indicative of future returns. The disposition effect, meanwhile, causes them to baulk at selling assets for less than they paid.

Overconfidence comes in three forms – studies have found that people tend to be overconfident not only in their own investing abilities but also their skill compared with others and their capacity to predict the future.

“The last one has shown to be important during the recent crisis,” says Magdalena Smith, chief executive of Behaviour Lab. “As the level of uncertainty has increased, investors’ confidence intervals have not expanded sufficiently to take into account the risks in these markets.”

Quant investors have incorporated some of these behavioural findings into their models. Nicholas Barberis, a professor of behavioural finance at the Yale School of Management, recently built an asset-pricing model using prospect theory, which goes some way to explaining 13 of 22 known anomalies in equity markets.

But existing behavioural models treat cognitive biases as more or less constant. The new research makes clear the way people think is shaped by experiences, conditions and events. The effects can cancel out or reinforce one another.

“While conventional wisdom sees cognitive biases as detrimental, evidence shows this need not always be the case, particularly when multiple biases may be at play,” says Darren Duxbury, professor of finance at Newcastle University.

One [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.irfa.2017.05.001) found that investors tend to follow the market when buying but take a contrarian view when selling. Another [showed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1042443114001292?via%3Dihub) the win-taking, loss-chasing “disposition effect” can be countered, in part, by the “house money” effect in which investors take more risk when on a roll.

Individual biases are also moulded by personal experience, researchers have found.

“Standard models assume that no matter how old you are, when making decisions you would look back at all historical financial data, not just the part of the sample you lived through,” Frydman says.

Investors that lived through the Great Depression were [less likely](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/126/1/373/1901343.) to invest in stocks. Central bankers that have experienced high inflation tend to be [more hawkish](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304393220300490). Other [experiments](https://economics.mit.edu/files/12105) have shown investors take more risk when interest rates fall below levels they have been used to, as if they keep a mental scorecard for what constitutes a fair return.

Frydman found investors [change](http://www.elisepayzan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/PayzanLeNestour_CurrentBiology.pdf) how much risk they see depending on recent experience. “After a big volatility spike, a large shift in the market the next day may not seem so large,” he says.

There are also nuances in how investors take in information. Michael Kirchler, a professor of finance at the University of Innsbruck, and his team asked a group of finance professionals and laypeople which of a selection of assets with the same expected return looked riskier. Their choices were not based on an asset’s standard deviation, as conventional financial theory assumes. Instead, they chose the assets with more skew – viewing those with a high probability of losses as the most risky.

In another study, Frydman [found](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.12851) that putting the purchase price of stocks in front of investors caused them to hang on to losers longer and sell winners faster than before. That matches an [earlier finding](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.12126) that a stock’s purchase price is logged in the brain when traders are considering whether to sell.

Martin Weber, a senior professor at the University of Mannheim, asked investors to allocate between return distributions for pairs of assets to test how they perceived stock correlations.

The participants relied on a simple counting heuristic, estimating correlations based on how often stocks moved together and ignoring the size of moves.

This rule-of-thumb version of beta is priced in the market, whereas a computationally sound version is not. In other words, the heuristic is at work in real-world investing as much as in the Mannheim lab.

A [2019 project](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3301277), meanwhile, found investment managers made poorer choices in the stocks they sold versus the ones they bought simply because they thought less about the assets they unloaded. That single flaw cost them 70 basis points a year in lost returns.

### Out of the lab

What can investors do with these new findings? Vitali Kalesnik, head of quantitative research at Research Affiliates, believes behavioural effects drive the “lion’s share” of the anomalies firms like his rely on. “We would love to understand more of the details,” he says. Another buy-side quant tells Risk.net he is starting to track the experimental research and expects to find ways to make money from it.

There are plenty of ideas that could work. Frydman has talked with a hedge fund about using computational neuroscience – a field devoted to mathematical modelling of the human brain – to devise new trading strategies.

One proposal would be to find out what investors look at when they are faced with something like a graph of asset prices – “literally, where their eyes move”.

“If you could predict where people’s attention is drawn to, it may give you insights into what they’ll think a stock chart is going to do in future,” Frydman says. In [experiments](https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f135164.pdf) at the California Institute of Technology, scientists used an algorithm to predict which parts of a stock chart would grab people’s attention. They then showed a link with how individuals went on to trade.

Other ideas would capitalise on variance in over-extrapolation, which [recent research](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/31/11/4345/4835351?redirectedFrom=fulltext) suggests is more prevalent among investors at certain times compared with others. “If you can get direct evidence of investor beliefs from surveys, the degree of over-extrapolation is a time-varying signal and can be input into a model,” Frydman says.

A deeper understanding of cognitive biases holds special promise for one particular corner of quant finance – agent-based models. These models populate a digital universe with many [heterogenous agents](https://www.risk.net/investing/quant-investing/7554016/doyne-farmers-next-big-adventure-capturing-the-universe) and run thousands or millions of simulations to build a picture of the future.

They have proven effective in explaining complexities in markets that conventional models struggle with, such as asset bubbles and liquidity crunches. Critically, such market-changing events seem to be caused by simple behavioural changes at the level of individual agents.

Bouchaud believes quants might create a more realistic representation of markets by categorising the laws of investor behaviour and programming them into agents. “You’d have a kind of modelling backbone that would allow you to make lots of predictions without tweaking the model every time to predict what you want to predict.”

Agent-Based models are still relatively new in investing. The approach is mostly in its “proof of concept” stage, says Michael Benzaquen, a scientist at the Ecole Polytechnique. But even if such models are years from direct use in investing, they can serve as a testing ground for the behavioural laws that guide market participants. If the models do a good job of predicting market moves, the rules they use can be encoded into simpler models, in the same way Barberis added prospect theory to an asset-pricing model.

The models could become quite granular, says Bouchaud, with specific behaviours linked to an investor’s experience or location. Well-known systematic strategies such as cross-sectional momentum fail to work in Japan, he points out. It’s unclear whether that’s due to differences in the psychology of Japanese investors or to more structural differences such as firms reporting differently.

There’s still more research to be done, though. Behavioural scientists still don’t have a clear understanding of how beliefs get turned into action. “We could make all sorts of mistakes in how we form our beliefs but if we don’t then act on them it will completely change how prices react,” says Stefano Giglio, a professor at the Yale School of Management.

This “transmission mechanism” from ideas to action could be equally important for fully rational investors, he adds. “Even if you believed everybody was rational, rational people change their minds all the time. They get new information. It’s important to know when and how people act on their beliefs.”

In a study of retail investors using Vanguard data, Giglio and his co-authors found the most optimistic investors prior to the Covid-19 pandemic sold more stocks when markets crashed. About half of pessimistic investors revised their expectations upwards.

There is reason for optimism. The sheer amount of research activity underway suggests further advances are on the cards. Economists used to criticise behavioural finance for mapping every puzzle in markets to a unique psychological mechanism. “Now it’s becoming clear that a small number of core psychological mechanisms can explain many separate behavioural finance findings,” Frydman says.

“My hope is that we can figure out where those core mechanisms come from. To make better predictions it’s crucial to figure out why people think as they do. Why are people overconfident in the first place and how did they become overconfident? Why do people anchor on certain reference points so heavily? What’s the psychological basis for these effects?”

When those questions are answered, he says, practitioners will have come a step closer to a “unified theory of human behaviour in finance”.

A unified theory, in turn, could form a new foundation for modelling.
