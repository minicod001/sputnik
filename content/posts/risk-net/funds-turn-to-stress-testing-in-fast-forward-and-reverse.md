{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Buy-side risk survey: Covid-19 is changing the way investors think about stress tests_{{< /quote >}}

This is the seventh in a series of articles connected to our buy-side risk survey. Click [here](https://www.risk.net/topics/buy-side-risk-survey-2020) to read the rest of the series.

In February and March, a public health crisis that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan spilled over into the global financial markets, wiping out more than three years of stock market gains in a matter of weeks. As investors dashed for cash, [cracks began to appear](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7505206/us-treasury-market-holds-its-breath-after-high-drama) in the typically safe and liquid market for US Treasuries. Banks with fortress balance sheets saw their commercial paper trade down 10–15 points. It was an extreme event, by any standards. But Morgan Stanley Investment Management had a stress test for that.

The suite of worst-case scenarios the firm routinely runs across its funds includes a speeded-up version of the 2008 financial crisis.

“Those who ran the 2008 crisis scenario as an instantaneous or at least a compressed shock would have had a forecast that came reasonably close to what actually occurred,” says Tatiana Segal, chief risk officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM).

“So, we did have a gauge of the potential impact of our portfolios, and I expect that is true for a lot of people.”

The magnitude of the market moves in March “was largely in the same ballpark” as the financial crisis in 2008, she says. What surprised investors was the speed at which it unfolded. “The velocity of this particular crisis was very different from what we observed in 2008 – both the speed of the selloff and the speed of the recovery,” says Segal.

For many investors, this sort of creative stress-testing was critical to surviving the Covid-19 crisis. In a recent Risk.net [survey](https://www.risk.net/investing/7658331/before-and-after-the-covid-19-storm-buy-side-risk-survey) of buy-side firms, 87% of respondents said stress tests using hypothetical or custom scenarios were very or somewhat useful in helping them navigate the selloff in March. Historical stress tests, which replicate the effect of past stress events on current positions, were also deemed useful by 79% of [survey](https://www.risk.net/investing/7658331/before-and-after-the-covid-19-storm-buy-side-risk-survey) respondents. By contrast, only 67% said the same about value-at-risk, the most commonly used statistical risk measure at buy-side firms.

Sudi Mariappa, global head of portfolio risk management at Pimco, [suggests why](https://www.risk.net/investing/7659571/pimcos-mariappa-on-iterating-through-the-covid-19-crisis) stress-testing is important: “In most scenarios, such as unstressed ones, volatility measures can be the most useful. But when looking at fat-tail events, the only way you can get an idea of the magnitude of that fatter tail is really by doing stress tests.”

Still, designing an effective stress test is no easy task. On this, risk managers are drawing some lessons from the Covid-19 crisis.

Andrew Chin, chief risk officer and head of quantitative research at AllianceBernstein, says risk managers need to be [more creative](https://www.risk.net/investing/risk-management/7662716/alliancebernsteins-cro-on-managing-risk-with-imagination) when constructing doomsday scenarios: “I think unfortunately we all lack imagination.”

According to the Risk.net survey, nearly 40% of buy-side firms rely primarily on the expert judgement of in-house risk managers to generate scenarios for stress tests, while a similar number lean on a mix of risk and portfolio managers. Fewer than 15% use third-party scenario generation tools.

The problem with this is that insiders can be inward-looking and overly reliant on past experience when assessing what could go wrong. “We have to be more thoughtful about what does a black swan event look like. And that’s very hard because we’re coloured by our experiences,” says Chin.

### Look past the past

Dan Bradley, chief risk officer at hedge fund Mariner Investing Group, agrees. He urges risk managers [to look beyond past events](https://www.risk.net/investing/risk-management/7661821/mariners-cro-on-avoiding-predictable-surprises) and traditional financial indicators when constructing future scenarios.

While there were some similarities between the last financial crisis and this one, there were also plenty of differences – starting with the cause of the turmoil. The 2008 crash was the result of failures and excesses within the financial system. Covid-19 was a truly exogenous shock.

“This was different in that it really came out of the blue,” says Bradley. “It shocked the system, but it had nothing to do with the system. It was a health crisis. It wasn’t part of the financial system, but it totally disrupted the system. That’s one of the things that will change the way people think going forward.”

One consequence is that other non-financial sources of risk – such as climate change, geopolitics and technology – may now feature more prominently in the hypothetical scenarios used in stress-testing.

Another lesson from the Covid-19 crisis is to not be overly specific when constructing scenarios. Accurately predicting the precise cause and arc of a crisis is nearly impossible.

“The Covid-19 crisis is a case study of an event no one would have been able to model as a scenario prior to the events unfolding,” says MSIM’s Segal. “Thinking back to swine flu scenarios, for example, they seem just hopelessly mild in comparison.”

She suggests focusing on the effects, not the cause, of a crisis when constructing scenarios: “Don’t necessarily start with thinking about the cause of the downturn – think about a maximum magnitude of an adverse shock and the resulting impact on your portfolios.”

MSIM runs two types of hypothetical stress tests. There are tests using conventional scenarios that start with a plausible trigger. Then, there are reverse stress tests, which consider the worst-case adverse moves that could cause its funds to breach risk limits or run against liquidity thresholds. These help the firm “identify potential vulnerabilities without necessarily rooting ourselves in causality”, says Segal: “This approach helps to hedge against the failure of imagination and construct a worst-case scenario that will meet the goal of a reasonably comprehensive downside capture.”

Mariappa has a similar philosophy. Pimco runs a variety of stress tests using historical data and custom scenarios sketched out by its risk and portfolio managers. But he sometimes finds the most useful exercise is simply to “shock” a portfolio to see what would happen if a particular sector fell by a certain amount.

“There’s a level of precision that I fear when we try to over-specify custom scenarios,” says Mariappa. “I like broader shocks to get a sense of what is ‘cuspy’ [and] has fatter tails.”

This sort of exercise can help risk managers identify potential correlation breaks and get a sense of how assets might behave in relation to each other during periods of stress, he adds.

The third and perhaps most critical lesson from the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing market turmoil is that market conditions – and especially liquidity – can deteriorate much faster than many investors previously assumed.

“This all happened in a pretty compressed period of time. And I think that was surprising for a lot of people,” says Chris Edge, head of investment risk at T. Rowe Price.

Future stress tests will need to account for the velocity of modern markets. And they may also have to be run more frequently to be useful. According to the Risk.net survey, only around 20% of firms currently run stress tests on a daily basis. More than 50% of respondents said their firms ran hypothetical stress tests monthly or quarterly, while around 18% run them annually.

The results surprised some risk managers. “I was kind of shocked that the frequency was anything other than daily,” says Mariner’s Bradley. “Portfolios are dynamic, markets are always moving, and inputs are always changing. I would expect people to be running these daily to see how they’re changing and evolving.” The input to stress scenarios should be reviewed on at least a monthly basis, he adds.

T. Rowe’s Edge says running hypothetical stress tests annually makes little sense. “If you’re only doing it annually, I’m not really sure what the benefit of that is, as those results might not be all that meaningful any more.” After all, the Covid-19 disease did not even exist in March 2019.
