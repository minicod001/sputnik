> _International accounting standards offer more favourable treatment of expected credit losses_

US subsidiaries of foreign banks are weighing the idea of repatriating loans booked in the US back to their parent companies once the Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard takes effect in 2020.

Repatriating loans could benefit the foreign banks because the loans would then be subject to new accounting standard IFRS 9, rather than the sterner CECL rules. This would allow the banks to hold less in loan-loss reserves, and conserve capital.

“If the deal is booked in the US with US clients, in theory it should be booked here,” a risk manager at a foreign bank tells Risk.net. “But it’s possible to have accounting arbitrage.”

CECL and IFRS 9 will require banks to recognise the [expected credit losses](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5452491/banks-grapple-with-ifrs-9-and-cecl-loan-loss-forecasting) of all loans – a stark departure from the current incurred-loss accounting standard, which recognises losses only after they’ve happened. But the two regimes differ in the way they treat loans of varying performance.

Under IFRS 9, loans are grouped into three stages: performing loans are considered stage 1 assets; stage 2 assets are significantly riskier; and at stage 3, the assets have become impaired, or lost value. Banks are required to set aside reserves to cover 12 months of expected credit losses for stage 1 assets. For the other groups, banks must hold provisions to cover the asset’s entire lifetime.

Under CECL, the entire loan book would be treated as if it contained nothing but stage 2 or 3 assets, with expected credit loss provisions covering the life of the loans.

Lourenco Miranda, head of model risk management for the Americas at Societe Generale, acknowledged the possibility of regulatory arbitrage [during a Risk.netwebinar](https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&referrer=&eventid=1675796&sessionid=1&key=933EBD472E276F4F79606E8F641F0A57&regTag=&sourcepage=register) on July 11.

“It’s something that happens with CCAR already and could happen with IFRS 9,” he said, referring to the Federal Reserve’s annual stress test, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review.

Societe Generale is currently reviewing its loan booking practices with US and European regulators for other regulatory reasons and does not engage in this sort of arbitrage, Miranda added.

The risk manager at the foreign bank says regulators are paying close attention to the issue and may step in pre-emptively to block any accounting arbitrage. “Regulators are asking us more and more to define the principles that determine whether loans that are originated in the US are booked in the US,” he says, adding that all the foreign banks “are looking at this”.

The Federal Reserve declined to comment on whether it was considering new rules to limit or prevent banks from transferring loans to non-US entities in order to avoid CECL.
