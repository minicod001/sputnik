> _Shift to remote working sees asset managers focus on comms, tech and cyber risks_

In an ironic twist on the notion of futurism, it is conceivable that, for asset managers, the post-Covid landscape will look less like Fritz Lang’s Metropolis and more like Little House on the Prairie. Certainly, managers are preparing for an operating environment that will look dramatically different from the densely city-centric concentrations of the pre-Covid world – with a greater dispersion of capabilities and a higher proportion of staff working from home.

As the pandemic continues to unfold, bulge bracket managers are reassessing their ability to maintain mission-critical operations with fewer staff in the office. Some believe the model for the future will feature many – if not most – employees working from home, bringing its own challenges for IT, cyber security and communications – including employee engagement. And with these changes, they say, will come a reduced need for office space, less reliance on outsourcing and a heightened sensitivity towards key risk indicators.

“The future is going to look very different in many respects from the way things are today,” says Mike Weigand, Covid leader at T. Rowe Price, which is one of many firms expecting to sustain a substantially remote workforce.

When lockdown began in March, companies started formalising plans to move employees. This required monitoring activities and controls from an operational risk standpoint – including people, technology, communications, business continuity and crisis management.

“While many of our entities were already accustomed to working remotely on a regular basis, the pandemic brought about a new scenario which saw us having to adapt to this situation on a long-term basis,” says Ernie Overholt, head of enterprise risk strategy at Vanguard

Although firms have been able to adapt quickly and maintain a high standard of work during the pandemic, it has highlighted the need to maintain lights-out readiness should another disaster strike. Companies are developing detailed, documented business recovery plans that identify their major processes across the organisation globally and highlight the associated risks.

### TacOps? 

And just as banks are [reworking their op risk scenarios](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7561696/banks-eye-post-pandemic-shake-up-of-op-risk-scenarios), asset managers are now factoring pandemic risk into their own scenarios. As many of the losses experienced by buy-side firms during the crisis have been operational in nature – such as errors in tracking fund indexes – managers are developing models that attempt to predict the probability of an operational error and the potential loss.

“Op risk used to be an audit function, looking at errors after the event. In the modern era, it’s become highly quantitative, and you need models to identify where you have concentrated risk,” said Edward Fishwick, global co-head of risk and quantitative analysis at BlackRock, during a [Risk.net webinar](https://www.risk.net/investing/risk-management/7649786/risk-live-virtual-week-playback-blackrocks-fishwick-on-buy-side-risk) on July 1.

Companies are also evaluating future technology risk and building up their IT infrastructure so that when the next crisis hits, they can provide secure remote access to company assets and allow for smooth team collaboration. An increased usage and scalability of cloud capabilities will enable companies to sustain new demands or react quickly during a crisis. “When all or most of your employees are working remotely, you have to look at what risks that presents from an IT operations standpoint,” says Overholt.

With a large segment of the workforce at home, IT and networking issues have become more critical. “From a technology perspective, this means investing in infrastructure to make it more resilient to support working from home. You need to set up processes to work remotely, to be able to monitor communications, exercise supervisory controls,” says Andrew Chin, chief risk officer at Alliance Bernstein.

In its IT evaluations, Axa is focusing specifically on identifying control deficits and new risks. It is conducting a ‘rapid impact assessment’ to identify emerging technology risks, vulnerabilities and threats related to Covid-19 before they materialise.

These include changes to security controls, the impact Covid-19 may have on compliance and regulatory obligations and any new technology or unexpected changes to the environment resulting from Covid-19. Axa’s changes will also include providing summaries for executive leadership and the board of the effects Covid-19 has had on the organisation, and its technology strategy.

“By progressing to the next stage in this new reality, we need to define the new standards of risk and control, which will inevitably change with new ways of working and greater influence from a technology consumption perspective,” says Frederik Simeon, head of the Axa operations global crisis management team.

Firms must also address the rising threats of cyber attacks, as perpetrators [seek to exploit vulnerabilities](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7649391/hacking-threats-growing-in-work-from-home-era-fear-cisos) in networks. Although companies are used to people working remotely, the scale and duration of remote work will require strong cyber security measures to mitigate this risk.

T. Rowe Price has incorporated remote access risk scenarios into its analysis and alerting systems, says Weigand, who nonetheless notes that such risks, by their nature, are constantly changing. Companies must ensure they are also adapting to the changing environment, he warns, adding that the firm educates and tests its associates regarding cyber risks on a regular basis.

“Axa has put security awareness campaigns in place and mandatory security training to support all employees, as they are all first line of defence when it comes to protecting against cyber attacks,” says Arnaud Tanguy, Axa group chief security officer. “With the majority of our people working remotely, the risk profile has certainly changed – with controls, such as a secured office environment and controlled internal network, becoming less relevant,” he adds.

### Office … space

Office space and data centres are also being re-evaluated as future operating models move towards having individuals and groups of staff that can work from home effectively.

Business continuity plans dictate that there should be adequate segregation of responsibilities should one group be infected and not  able to perform their duties.

Before the pandemic, many business continuity plans were predicated on getting critical staff to a contingency site, which in the present circumstances is impossible.

“A legitimate question is: what is the role of a contingency site? We now know that we can plan for a broader recovery working from home than pre-pandemic,” says Nigel Smith, head of operational risk at Federated Hermes.

Alliance Bernstein is re-assessing the need for multiple disaster recovery sites when alternative work arrangements can be made. “Why do we need those DR sites? Maybe our backup is that we work from home. We’re rethinking how many DR sites we need,” says Chin.

Before the pandemic, some companies stipulated that offshore employees had to work from a physical office to maintain more effective controls. Inevitably, such contracts had to be reversed in short order to accommodate working from home.

If it turns out that a significant percentage of employees chooses to work from home, will it cause asset managers to rethink their real estate needs?

“Absolutely,” says Weigand. “That’s something we’re thinking about from a personnel and team standpoint, as well as corporate services in terms of a global footprint.”

Many expect to see a tangible reduction in real estate costs. Among them is Goldman Sachs, which in normal times expects between 85–90% of buildings to be populated – but is planning for a future where physical space is needed for only 65–70% of employees, said Anthony Mirabile, regional head of consumer and investment management division operations at Goldman.

Further impact on the global footprint could occur in the adjustment of outsourcing arrangements. For companies such as T. Rowe Price that have outsourced segments of their operations, close contact with service providers has been critical to ensure they can continue to perform these services in a timely manner, as workers transition to a work-at-home environment.

“We have regular touch points with them,” says Weigand. “So we are very mindful of that and continue that ongoing dialogue throughout.”

As part of its own Covid-19 response, Axa’s global procurement team assessed and monitored key suppliers and their remote capabilities, including service continuity capabilities. In France and Morocco alone, its teams were able to source and supply almost 2,000 laptops within a very short space of time to ensure business continuity in these regions. In addition, all of its near and offshore suppliers were able to provide frictionless services.

But outsourcing relationships are being reviewed critically by some managers, and there is likely to be a reduction in the number of third-party vendors as managers take the opportunity to re-evaluate them. Some with service providers in India, for example, are revisiting these relationships for reasons not necessarily related just to the pandemic. While the country’s sudden imposition of lockdown gave firms little or no warning about being locked out of their premises, some also cite weather-related worries about brownouts and related grid shutdowns during monsoon season.

“We were concerned about that,” says Alliance Bernstein’s Chin. “We are considering whether to take things back from offshore to mitigate the risks of disruptions from the pandemic. To prepare for that, we started training our staff here to take over those functions. Because of the heightened risk, we might have to duplicate what we had in India,” he adds.

### Home thoughts

The issues experienced early on in the move to remote working were quite different from those managers are now facing. In the first few weeks, concerns revolved around whether employees could perform their jobs remotely, with an acute focus on logistics.

“Our first priority was making sure we had the right equipment. There were lots of technology issues – we couldn’t get Wi-Fi, screens,” says Chin.

“We surveyed employees to see what they needed to work effectively from home. Instead of asking employees to buy equipment on their own, we ordered equipment for all our employees based on the survey,”

However, the conversation has since shifted from day-to-day operations to maintaining employee morale through coaching, mentoring and training, from senior leaders conducting town halls to encouraging employees to take time off to spend with family and recharge.

“We had to guard against becoming an organisation that just focuses on processing, but continue to focus on the people aspect,”said Goldman’s Mirabile, on a recent webinar. “We’ve become much more connected than pre-Covid.”

The sudden transition from having employees physically in the office to working remotely also underscored the importance of establishing trust in working relationships.

“As a manager, I learned to deal differently with employees who are working remotely. If there is a time where my company needs all the positive effects of trust at work, it is now,” says Simeon.

Communication is arguably never more critical than during periods of uncertainty, and the crisis has thrown into sharp focus the need for clear communication channels. By embedding agile elements at company or team levels, they are far better equipped to respond to the challenges of the crisis.

On a team level, asset managers have invested both time and technology in communications that include mission-critical initiatives, such as crisis portals, but also tools for sharing tips and tricks during lockdown and for collegial well-being, such as virtual coffee meetings, after-work drinks and staff celebrations.

Firms have seen value in team-wide video calls or broadcast sessions during which senior team members provide updates and answer questions. Internal portals keep employees in the loop with important updates. Many firms also increased their use of social media to ensure internal or customer needs are addressed in a timely manner.

Soliciting employee feedback has also played a critical role in establishing next steps. When T. Rowe Price surveyed its employees on their general concerns, mass transit ranked near the top, especially in major cities. With schools and summer camps being closed, working parents were prevented from returning to the office. In preparation for a phased, voluntary return that was scheduled to begin in early July, it divided employees into three groupings on a rotating basis, with the office outfitted with floor markers, elevator capacity limits, physical separation and free face masks.

“We want associates who voluntarily choose to enter the office to feel as comfortable as possible,” says Weigand.
