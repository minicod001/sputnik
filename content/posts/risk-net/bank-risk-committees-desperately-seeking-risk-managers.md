Regulators have spent the last several years toughening their rules on the quality of banks’ risk oversight. They had good reason to act: in the years that followed the crisis, it was acknowledged risk committees were often too stretched to wield proper oversight of banks’ risk appetites, and in many cases too lacking in expertise to understand them – even where they met regularly enough to form a proper view. But despite some marquee appointments, how much has actually changed?

Today, those committees include many executives with financial backgrounds, even a few with gilt-edged careers, such as former UK chancellor Alistair Darling, who sits on the board of Morgan Stanley. But about half of the risk committee members of top banks come from outside the sector: utilities, publishing, technology and commercial property, to name a few ([click here to see table B](#1), at the end of this article). Among them are: Franz Humer, former chairman of the Roche pharmaceutical company; Suzanne Vautrinot, a retired major general in the US Air Force; François Thibault, an agricultural engineer known for developing [the recipe for Grey Goose](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-23/francois-thibault-grey-goose-cellar-master-gives-martini-recipe) vodka; and Ernesto Zedillo, a former president of Mexico.

Critics say panels are light on execs with frontline risk management experience. Of the 82 people sitting on the risk committees of 15 large global banks studied by Risk.net, only four are former chief risk officers. That number is unchanged from 2012, when Risk.net last [counted](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/2187658/jp-morgan-loss-highlights-lack-risk-experts-bank-committees).

Roughly two-thirds of the 82 total have a background in finance – 41 are former bankers, while 15 previously worked in asset management and insurance. About half of those on the committees had risen to the C-suite – 29 to chief executive.

So, does the lack of hands-on risk expertise matter? Some were surprised by the dearth of it on the committees.

“There should be at least one independent CRO on that board. Somebody who understands the risks of the industry,” says Craig Spielmann, CEO of consultancy RiskTao, and the former global head of operational risk systems and analytics at the Royal Bank of Scotland.

Another former bank risk manager comments: “It looks a bit patchy, to say the least.”

Some take a more optimistic view, however, arguing the level of risk management expertise on committees has improved dramatically since the [dog days](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/1510655/risk-committees-under-scrutiny-after-lehman-collapse) of the crisis.

“They are getting more risk experts,” says Mark Watson, deputy leader for Americas financial services board matters at EY, of the committees. “They may not have been cast as risk experts, but have been in prominent roles in the financial services industry overseeing risk, maybe from the first line, or maybe from another industry. A lot of them are former operating executives.”

Yet others note the job is now getting harder. Risk now extends well beyond loan and trading books to cyber attacks, political convulsions, reputational hazards and other events for which experts from other fields would be useful.

“The job of the risk function has changed so much even in the time that I took the role,” says [Daniel Moore](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5467736/scotiabanks-daniel-moore-on-the-evolution-of-the-cro), CRO at Scotiabank since April last year, and previously markets CRO for two years. “Whereas once our main focus was on corporate commercial credit, our risk portfolio has expanded to include dimensions of data, anti-money-laundering, conduct, operational risk, cyber security and more.”

Constructive dissent, whether from a mix of skills or personalities, is the goal. Moore says Scotiabank’s risk committee has shown an increased willingness to probe and challenge management on topics, such as free trade, Brexit, cyber and money laundering. “We enjoy a lot more challenge, a lot more advisory function than we did in the past,” he says.

### Who qualifies?

The regulatory requirements set out in the Federal Reserve’s [Enhanced Prudential Standards](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-03-27/pdf/2014-05699.pdf) for banks with over $50 billion in consolidated assets – which were being drafted in 2012 when Risk.net conducted its first survey and were finalised in 2014 – are broadly drawn.

Banks are required to appoint “at least one risk management expert having experience in identifying, assessing and managing risk exposures of large, complex financial firms” to their risk committees. The rule also states that all risk committee members should generally “have an understanding of risk management principles and practices relevant to the company”.

Regulators in other jurisdictions have similar requirements, but the language is somewhat softer than the Fed rule. The European Banking Authority, under guidelines issued in 2017 implementing the European Union’s Capital Requirements Directive IV, requires that “members of the risk committee should have, individually and collectively, appropriate knowledge, skills and expertise concerning risk management and control practices”.

Similarly, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority requires that “members of the risk committee must have appropriate knowledge, skills and expertise to fully understand and monitor the risk strategy and the risk appetite of the firm”.

Some banks clearly meet those requirements. Linda Bammann, a former deputy head of risk management at JP Morgan, leads its risk committee. At Credit Suisse, Andreas Gottschling, ex-CRO at the Erste Group, fulfils that role. Two other banks also have CROs on their committees: Bank of America has Thomas Woods, former CRO at CIBC, while RBS has Morten Friis, former CRO at Royal Bank of Canada.

The level of risk management expertise on the committees of other banks is harder to gauge. For instance, Bank of America says in its [proxy statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000119312518078695/d501004ddef14a.htm) that “all committee members satisfy the risk expertise requirements for directors of a risk committee under the Federal Reserve Board’s Enhanced Prudential Standards”. Its risk committee includes the former publisher of the largest Spanish-language newspaper in the US and an ex-Nasa scientist.

Jeremy Kress, a former Fed attorney who helped draft the rule, notes the regulatory language was drafted broadly so that different types of risk management experience could qualify. “You would expect that someone who has worked as a CFO at a large financial institution would qualify, and that seems to be the vast majority,” he says.

There is a spectrum of views on the level of financial risk management experience that committee members must possess, and the benefits of seeking out candidates from outside finance. There is even debate over whether those from regulatory backgrounds qualify.

“Being a member of the Federal Reserve Board does not necessarily qualify you to be a member of the risk committee,” says Mark Carey, co-president of the Garp Risk Institute and a former Fed economist. “You could be somebody that spends all of their time on monetary policy and doesn’t know much about financial institutions. In contrast, if you have been deeply involved in banking supervision and regulation issues, maybe you are qualified.”

Anthony Santomero, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, is on the risk committee of Citigroup, while Elizabeth Duke and Susan Bies, both former Fed governors, sit on the committees of Wells Fargo and Bank of America, respectively.

Others, however, say regulators bring an understanding of the intricacies of policy, and committees can benefit from that first-hand knowledge.

Moore says the chairman of Scotiabank’s risk committee, Tiff Macklem, a former senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, has been instrumental in bringing “a challenger function” to the bank’s risk committee, thanks to his different perspectives on risk management.

### Value of VAR

A risk committee not only needs to have an understanding of market, credit and operational risks, but also needs to be able to interpret and see behind metrics like value-at-risk, or VAR, and expected shortfall. Some believe that deeper knowledge of quantitative risk management is sorely needed on the committees – and missing in members who lack a risk background.

“What you see too often is a focus on simplistic metrics like VAR. These are meant to summarise the risk – but they come with assumptions, and if the people who are receiving the information are not aware of the assumptions, it will be very difficult for them to ask the right questions,” says Evan Sekeris, a partner at Oliver Wyman.

It typically falls to CROs to bring committee members up to speed – several of whom say they spend an inordinate amount of time at meetings clarifying the meaning of basic metrics such as VAR. For instance, committee members might assume, incorrectly, that VAR is equivalent to the maximum loss the bankcould suffer, says a risk executive at a Swiss bank.

“A VAR of $30 million doesn’t mean the maximum you can lose is $30 million. It means every hundred days, you will lose at least $30 million – but you could lose a billion and still have a VAR of $30 million. When a new risk committee member joins, we spend a lot of time explaining what the risk measures mean.”

These tutorials, however, leave committee members in the peculiar position of having to evaluate the risk management practices of the very person they depend on to understand those practices. Invariably, the bank’s CRO is the principal conduit of information to risk committees, regardless of their make-up.

One risk officer at a North American banksays he has a one-on-one discussion with his risk committee’s chair prior to each meeting, covering what’s the priority for each of them. At committee meetings, the CRO then presents an assessment of risks across the bank, including a high-level summary and an appendix that provides detailed analysis of key risks. The meetings typically run for one-and-a-half days, he says. At the end, business and risk specialists from the bank are brought in to discuss topics of particular interest to the committee.

How much information a risk officer gives a committee should be carefully balanced, says one CRO at a North American bank, as non-experts can easily be deluged with detail. Rather than providing voluminous commentary and tables, the CRO says he creates infographics that convey the key points.

“We want to present more signal and less noise. We try to provide enough information that the board can appropriately discharge their duties – which isn't to say it’s high-level,” he says. “We need to be careful of the perspective that more information represents better disclosure. That’s not the case, in my view.”

Others believe the committees don’t necessarily need to understand the intricacies of risk down to the desk level – but they do need to be able to ask the right questions. If they detect a pattern in a given set of transactions, they need to know enough to address it, and to evaluate the answers they're getting.

“I'm less upset that somebody doesn’t know how to do Greeks than if a head of a risk committee doesn’t know how to do risk at all, especially how to think about it strategically,” Carey, the co-president of Garp Risk Institute, says.

### Shifting skillsets

Carey’s stance nods to what many see as the changing role of the CRO function itself. Many argue it is increasingly likely the CRO of the future will have a stronger background in [non-financial risk](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5687091/regulators-zeroing-in-on-non-financial-risk-say-banks), given regulators’ tightening focus on the discipline, and a growing consensus that operational risks pose a bigger existential threat to banks than market or credit risk.

This focus also needs to be reflected in bankrisk committees, CROs say. Op risk subcategories such as cyber and misconduct have taxonomies all their own, and justify, some say, a more varied range of expertise.

Op risks, and regulators’ response to them, can make or break a bank. For a long time, Wells Fargo was seen as one of the few US lenders to burnish its reputation in the years that followed the financial crisis; that changed overnight in September 2016, when Wells was found to have [foisted](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/2474346/wells-fargo-pays-the-price-for-ghost-account-fraud) ghost accounts on to unsuspecting customers for years, demolishing its corporate image and [hobbling it](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/5423346/top-10-op-risks-2018-regulatory-risk) with multimillion-dollar penalties.

The bank has responded at the board level. Wells now has risk subcommittees dealing with technology, information security, cyber risk, data governance and management.

Wells’s risk committee has seen substantial turnover since its phony accounts scandal came to light. Enrique Hernandez, CEO of a private security firm, stepped down as chairman of the risk committee and was replaced by Karen Peetz, the former president of BNY Mellon, in February 2017. Four others – including former US energy secretary Federico Peña and Lloyd Dean, CEO of Dignity Health – were removed from the committee. New members include Juan Pujadas, who led PwC’s US advisory practice until 2003 and was previously the CRO of Santander’s international investment banking arm from 1995 to 1998.

Wells Fargo is not the only bank to pay the price for failing to effectively manage the phalanx of so-called non-financial risks, such as fraud, cyber-attack and technology outages.

Earlier this year, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia was fined A$700 million ($515 million) – the biggest corporate settlement in the country’s history – for breaches of anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws. A [report](https://www.apra.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/apra-releases-cba-prudential-inquiry-final-report-accepts-eu) published by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in May criticised the bank for overlooking non-financial operational, compliance and conduct risks as well as “cultural themes” that hurt the bank, even as its CRO presented the board with a picture of its financial risk.

Mark Lawrence, a former CRO at ANZ, says the board-level oversight of CBA was severely lacking. “The board just didn’t know what it didn’t know.”

At a Basel Committee on Banking Supervision forum for bank CROs [held earlier this year](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5687091/regulators-zeroing-in-on-non-financial-risk-say-banks), regulators made it clear they expect global systemically important financial institutions to focus more on just these sorts of risks, and several of those present indicated they were considering appointing heads of non-financial risk in response. Some banks have moved to reflect this in their risk committees too: Citigroup has a subcommittee on data governance, quality and integrity.

Sanjay Sharma, chairman of GreenPoint Global and a former CRO of global arbitrage and trading at RBC Capital Markets, says risk committee members should be selected for their expertise in both financial and non-financial risk. “Risk at banks is not just financial now,” he says. “You don’t need marquee names – what you need are technocrats.”

### Time-consuming process

Yet another issue is the amount of time a committee member has for the job.

“I remain convinced that risk committee directors are too busy to do their jobs effectively,” says Kress, the former Fed lawyer. “Many of these directors have full-time jobs. Most of them sit on at least one other public company board. How can we expect them to oversee risk at a $2 trillion organisation when they've got so much else going on?”

Kress advocates limiting risk committee chairs to serving on no more than one other board of a public company, and having the Fed review the outside commitments of committee members. The quality of a bank’s risk committee could factor into the Fed’s [new risk rating system](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5542051/fed-risk-rating-system-unifies-stress-testing-and-3lod) for banks, he adds.

Several people Risk.net spoke to for this article stress the need for greater independence by risk committee directors. Even if they meet statutory requirements for independence, they may still have deep ties to the companies they’ve worked at in the past, as well as other types of conflicts.

“You could be completely independent under that rule, but if you were college roommates with the CEO and have served on boards together, maybe that’s not as independent as it looks,” says a risk management consultant.
