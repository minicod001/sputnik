The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has begun consulting on a guiding set of principles on operational resilience for financial firms – teeing up a period of rulemaking designed to ensure that banks can continue to maintain critical services through pandemics, large-scale system outages or natural disasters.

The [principles](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d509.htm) are vague on how compliance with such expectations will be measured, however – an acknowledgment that different countries will likely take [differing approaches](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/6747901/basel-set-to-update-op-risk-and-resilience-principles) to enforcing the rules, such as setting timed targets by which a firm must return to operational functionality following an outage.

“Regulators have been careful at not pushing out too much national guidance. Many held off until this came out. There clearly is an effort to co-ordinate between international regulatory agencies,” says Evan Sekeris, head of model validation at PNC Financial Group, and a former US supervisor.

In some Group of 20 countries, the rulemaking process is well under way. The UK Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) last year [issued a consultation](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7234291/uk-regulator-issues-plans-for-bank-ops-resilience) on operational resilience, with the deadline for comments extended to October 1 this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The watchdog said firms would not need to meet any new requirements resulting from the consultation, which will apply to all UK banks and larger insurers, before the end of 2021.

Operational resilience is also mentioned in a [set of rules](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/6714296/financial-firms-toil-to-meet-new-eu-rules-on-outsourcing) governing third-party risk issued last year by the European Banking Authority.

The Basel paper establishes that resilience is a multidisciplinary effort, involving operational risk, business continuity planning, IT, vendor risk and governance. It asks banks to map the interconnections between resources necessary to deliver critical operations.

The Covid pandemic has highlighted the importance of resilience as companies adapt to staff and customers working from home, deal with [increased risk](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7517326/virus-weakens-banks-defences-against-internal-fraud) of internal and external fraud, and [rethink](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7561696/banks-eye-post-pandemic-shake-up-of-op-risk-scenarios) their need for backup facilities. Banks have surprised with their ability to maintain services during the crisis: online banking and call centres have stayed open, and markets and payment systems have functioned.

“Ironically, these are the very developments that are causing the Basel Committee increased concern,” notes the head of operational risk at an international bank. “Although this technology has made banking more resilient during a pandemic, it’s created concentrations of data and single points of failure.”

The Basel Committee did not specify what metrics should be used for measuring resilience, instead noting that work on metrics was at an early stage and requested feedback from banks on what metrics they use. The UK has already ploughed its furrow, however, asking banks to set ‘impact tolerances’, including time limits on return to operations following a disruption or outage to a critical business service. Companies will be expected to conduct self-assessments of their operational resilience, and communicate the results to the regulator.

Arthur Lindo, chair of the Basel Committee’s operational resilience working group and a deputy director at the US Federal Reserve, [told a Risk conference](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/6747901/basel-set-to-update-op-risk-and-resilience-principles) last year that the Fed was not inclined to be prescriptive when it comes to setting impact tolerances. The Fed declined to make Lindo available to comment.

“Many people see metrics as important, but others say time to recovery is important for business continuity – but when you’re talking about resilience, your metrics have to change,” says Sekeris.

The Bank of England’s approach was, in part, an explicit response to instances of high-profile [tech failures](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5689651/boe-to-set-tolerance-levels-for-operational-disruptions) at UK banks TSB and RBS, which left millions of customers unable to access bank accounts and other services – in some cases, for more than a week.

Basel’s approach follows the UK in expecting firms to [construct scenarios](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7552516/covid-scenarios-finding-the-worst-worst-case) to test their ability to maintain critical business services in the event of a severe but plausible disruption of operations. The UK paper is somewhat more detailed in specifying how they should go about this, however. For example, plausibility could be determined by modelling incidents or near misses that have occurred, and firms would be permitted to remain outside their impact tolerances for extreme situations such as a failure of essential infrastructure.

Banks have been actively revising their operational risk scenarios since the pandemic struck, incorporating pandemic risk into scenarios for other operational risks, such as rogue trading, mis-selling, fraud and physical attacks.

Some view the Basel Committee’s less prescriptive approach as a recognition of the progress that banks have made in resilience planning.

“We already have a scenario process. We have a business continuity process, and a lot of organisations have made a lot of how they dealt with Covid based on business continuity. The committee recognises that banks have well-established risk management processes,” says Andrew Sheen, a risk management consultant.

Concurrent with the operational resilience principles, the Basel Committee also issued [updated principles](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d508.htm) for the sound management of operational risk (PSMOR), which had last been revised in 2011. The most significant change has been to explicitly extend existing best-practice expectations such as the classic three lines of defence approach to op risk to other facets of a bank, such as its IT infrastructure.

By issuing two separate papers, the Basel Committee is sending a message that operational resilience and operational risk are separate concepts, argues Sekeris. The former is concerned with keeping the lights on, while the latter is concerned primarily with measuring financial and non-financial impacts.

“If you look at the op resilience document, they highlight that op risk management is one of several elements, along with third-party risk, business continuity and governance. They’re sending a message that op resilience is a cross-disciplinary effort. By creating two separate documents, they are enforcing the idea that resilience is not merely an enhancement of op risk management,” he says.

Basel’s work on updating the PSMOR had sat dormant after being shelved in [acrimony](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/6475751/op-risk-capital-looking-back-in-anger), multiple sources say, following the transatlantic split that emerged between US and European regulators over the Basel Committee’s decision to axe op risk capital modelling.

The comment period on both consultations concludes on Friday, November 6.
