{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Banks question CCP resilience to system outages, as debate swirls over non-default losses_{{< /quote >}}

The lights have never gone off at clearing houses such as LCH and Ice, but from time to time they flicker.

Regulators have counted a few dozen operational outages at central counterparties over the past year – all of them brief systems interruptions that affected banks and other users in a limited and inexpensive way.

An extended shutdown would be more damaging, though. Clearing members are starting to ask whether CCPs are sufficiently capitalised to withstand both real and potential loss events of this nature.

“If there were to be a longer-term outage in places where we’re dependent on market infrastructures and subject to mandatory clearing, it could be a problem,” says Marnie Rosenberg, global head of clearing house risk and strategy at JP Morgan.

With clearing dominated by a few large CCPs in key markets, failure of a critical provider could magnify disruption for users and escalate losses.

“There’s only one major, global alternative for each major asset class from a swaps perspective, so there aren’t that many options,” adds Rosenberg.

Attention on clearing house resilience has intensified following a nine-digit default at [Nasdaq Clearing](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/6046941/nasdaq-default-raises-questions-over-direct-clearing), and the industry is wrestling with the slippery problem of who should pay for [losses](https://www.risk.net/regulation/6183401/clearing-houses-urge-cftc-to-act-on-non-default-losses) caused by events unrelated to member default, such as cyber attack, natural disaster or IT meltdown.

Lawmakers have proposed recovery and resolution rules for clearing houses, including provisions for non-default losses, but the plans are controversial. Participants fear they will end up paying the bill for events that are out of their control.

To date, reported outages have been relatively infrequent, and have not resulted in significant financial harm. LCH, the world’s largest swap clearer, suffered [15 failures](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7081471/lch-leads-top-ccps-on-operational-failures) of its core clearing systems during the 12 months to the end of June, according to public data. These failings caused the systems to be offline for seven hours and 35 minutes in total. Ice Clear Europe reported six failures, lasting a combined total of two hours.

No other CCP reported more than three outages during the same 12-month period. For LCH, the 15 reported shutdowns represent an aggregate for the five separate clearing services LCH operates for individual asset classes: swaps, foreign exchange, repos, equities and commodities. A single systems issue that affects all services is reported multiple times.

Clearing house operators are keen to emphasise that losses from systems failures are rare and, where they do occur, the impact is limited.

An LCH spokesperson says: “As a leading global multi-asset class clearing house, LCH plays a systemically important role in financial markets. We take our commitment to best-in-class risk management and resiliency seriously. Our track record of 99.97% availability speaks for itself.”

Dmitrij Senko, chief risk officer at Eurex Clearing, says: “Operational losses are typically small in contrast to operational risk hypothetical scenarios that can be large. Real losses happen, but they’re extremely small.”

The financial impact may be small, but the disruption can be widespread. VP Securities, the Danish central securities depository, suffered [technical glitches](https://www.vp.dk/Post-Trade-Services/Evaluation-of-the-Danish-market-migrating-to-T2S) during its migration to the Target2-Securities settlement platform in 2018, resulting in thousands of unmatched trades. The problems were ascribed to inadequate processing capacity, leaving VP unable to handle incoming instructions from customers and T2S. The firm later admitted it had failed to test the new system sufficiently.

Failures are not restricted to commercial entities. A meltdown in the Bank of England’s real-time gross settlement system in 2014 affected payments totalling nearly £300 billion ($390 billion). The system is undergoing a [complete overhaul](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/rtgs-renewal-programme).

### The rules, as they stand

Large banks measure and model the effect of events with low probability but potentially severe financial impact as part of stress tests such as the US Federal Reserve’s [CCAR regime](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5462826/ccar-gives-op-risk-modelling-a-new-lease-of-life). Many believe that CCPs should also consider such one-in-100-year events. “Living in Holland, you should think about what would happen if the dykes burst. We should think about it, but nobody wants to think about it,” says Arnoud Siegmann, chief risk officer at EuroCCP, which clears mainly cash equities.

Like banks, CCPs in Europe are required to hold capital for operational risk under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir). CCPs must calculate capital using either the basic indicator approach or, if their supervisor allows them, the advanced measurement approach.

The basic indicator approach uses a simple percentage of revenues to set capital – in this case, 15%. The advanced measurement approach is a more risk-sensitive measure, but is floored at 80% of the capital calculated under the basic indicator approach.

LCH, Eurex Clearing, EuroCCP and SIX x-clear use the basic indicator approach.

In the US, clearers are required to hold one year’s worth of operating expenses to cover non-default losses under rules laid down by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Infrastructure firms in general, including clearing houses, settlement systems and depositories, must hold at least six months’ worth of operating expenses to cover the costs of a recovery or orderly wind-down of operations, within the global CPMI/Iosco Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. In a [disclosure](http://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2018/uploads/DTCC-Capital-Management-Statement.pdf), the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp states that it maintains a plan for raising additional capital should it fall close to or below the minimum amount required.

Scaling capital to operating expenses is a cause for concern, clearing members say. Without full insight into the level of operational risks being incurred, users complain they can’t know whether the CCP holds enough capital to mitigate those risks.

“The rules are reasonably clear in a business-as-usual, non-recovery scenario. The challenge is that CCP capital should be scaled to operational risk, not operational costs. There’s plenty of scope for operational issues to give rise to significant losses, and therefore operational capital should be scaled appropriately,” says Bill Stenning, managing director of clearing, regulatory and strategic affairs at Societe Generale.

For CCPs, principal sources of operational risk include availability, service deficiency, damage to physical assets, and legal risk. A [report on CCP resilience](https://www.jpmorgan.com/jpmpdf/1320747815087.pdf) prepared by prominent sell-side and buy-side firms notes that CCPs are exposed to “cyber attacks, operational failures, fraud, theft, malicious acts of employees, and credit deterioration”. All of the disclosed outages at LCH were related to trade registration – neither margin calculations nor the margin runs were affected.

CCP disclosures provide a quarterly snapshot of system outages, but offer little further detail. Participants are left to wonder whether the reported interruptions are trivial, or signs of more troubling problems brewing underneath the surface.

“To the extent that these incidents feed into public disclosure, are they are mere annoyances or are there some potential losses that can be much higher?” says Ulrich Karl, head of clearing services at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.

Operational losses are a subset of non-default losses, a category that also includes investment and custodial losses. Options Clearing Corporation earlier this year [filed for a rule change](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7048526/us-clearers-move-to-dole-out-losses-besides-default) that would distribute part of operational losses – cyber, fraud, theft and others – to its members. Ice Clear Credit filed to have its members cover part of the cost of investment and custodial losses, but excluded pure operational risk.

The fact that clearers are taking different approaches to the treatment of non-default losses raises the uncertainty that a large operational loss may exceed a CCP’s available resources.

“There needs to be an appropriately sized capital framework to cover non-default losses similar to what banks have,” says Rosenberg from JP Morgan. “The amount of op risk capital they hold, which is a few hundred million at best, may not be enough to recover from a major operational loss event.”

### Defensive measures

CCPs maintain dedicated teams of op risk professionals to ensure that business operations can survive a disruption. EuroCCP has four staff members working in operational risk, among a total headcount of 60. “The op risk people are mainly concerned with ‘did something not go according to procedure?’ – in which case, you rate the event, and if it’s serious, we make it an incident. And if it’s really serious, it becomes a crisis. This can be small things like somebody losing a laptop to serious things like the whole system doesn’t work,” says Siegmann.

Like most large organisations, EuroCCP maintains dual data centres with failover, or backup, capabilities to shield its operations from hardware failures. It also maintains a golden copy of daily transactions stored offline. Trades are netted at the end of each day, and settlement instructions are sent to central securities depositories.

“In that sense, you can rebuild your administration pretty quickly from what is already in the central securities depositories, because you send that every night. For a cash equities CCP, it’s relatively easy to reproduce what is there. But the situation might be more complicated for a derivatives CCP,” says Siegmann.

Protective measures are designed to ensure that clearing houses, a crucial building block in the financial edifice, continue to operate as required. Regulators acknowledge the systemic importance of these entities, and have explored how member defaults could [rapidly spread](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5299766/twin-member-default-would-hit-up-to-23-ccps) contagion through a wide network of clearing firms.

A senior executive at one CCP says his firm is aware of its importance in maintaining the basic functioning of markets: “Operational risk in general and cyber risk in particular is one of the things that takes up most of my time – whether that’s overseeing penetration testing, running scenarios, or resilience planning our members and key service providers. We’re incredibly cognisant of our role as a key hub for derivatives trading – people depend on us for the market to function.”

Aside from existing legislation covering financial market infrastructure, such as Emir and Mifid in Europe and the Dodd-Frank Act in the US, lawmakers are debating new recovery and resolution rules for CCPs. Proposed European Union laws would require a CCP to contribute a portion of its capital in the event of a non-default loss, but [clearing members say this is too low](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5467486/a-floored-plan-europes-ccp-recovery-rules-draw-fire) to cover losses occurring from extreme events such as cyber attack.

“As we focus more on that topic, we need to have thought through the what-if scenarios. We haven’t yet had a situation where a CCP has been down for an extended period of time. But the whole point of recovery and resolution planning is to have in place an idea of what you’ll do if and when such a thing happens. As you test these plans, you may find things that aren’t suitable,” says Stenning at Societe Generale.

With billions on the hook in the form of posted margin, banks are pushing for a greater say in how CCPs manage risks that could have an impact on collateral, especially investment and operational risks. End-users, too, would welcome representation on a committee that oversees CCP governance and controls.

“There needs to be some mechanism for CCPs to gather member and participant feedback before there’s a material risk change that impacts our exposure,” says Rosenberg.

Any process for soliciting user input on non-default losses needs to be separate from CCP risk committees, adds Stenning. This is necessary to ensure member voices are heard and their views are treated independently.

If clearing members have their way, they won’t be the ones left alone in the darkness when the lights go out at a clearing house.
