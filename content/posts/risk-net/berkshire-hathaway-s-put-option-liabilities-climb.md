Berkshire Hathaway incurred a $597 million loss from sold equity index put options over the first half of the year, as the derivatives moved closer to their strike prices following the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis.

The fair value liability of the options on Berkshire’s balance sheet climbed to almost $1.6 billion as of end-June, from $968 million six months prior and just under $1.5 billion a year ago. At end-March, after several weeks in which key indexes fell between 20% and 25%, Berkshire’s obligation was a whopping $2.4 billion.

Though as of end-June the firm’s liability was up only slightly year-on-year, the notional amount of derivatives outstanding fell 41% over this period to $14.3 billion, with $10 billion expiring over the last six months of 2019. This means the firm’s liability as a percentage of notional exposure was much higher at end-June than the year prior.

Berkshire is only on the hook to pay out the put options if they are in-the-money to the counterparties on their exercise dates. If the equity indexes referenced are not below the strike price at these times, then they will expire worthless.

### What is it?

Berkshire Hathaway wrote a series of equity index put option contracts between 2004 and 2008 on four major stock indexes, one US and three international. The options are European-style, meaning they can only be exercised on their expiration dates.

At end-June, the remaining weighted average life of all contracts was 1.3 years. According to Berkshire, substantially all of the contracts will have expired by February 2023. Chief executive Warren Buffett said that between a fifth and a fourth of the options would expire by end-2020.

### Why it matters

Now that top stock indexes have rebounded from their coronavirus-induced lows to within striking distance of their pre-pandemic peaks, the likelihood Berkshire will have to pay out on its sold put options is once again remote. But nothing can be taken for granted. It took just six weeks at the end of Q1 to catapult its exposure into the billions. If the world economy stumbles again in dealing with the coronavirus, the options may once again move close to being in-the-money.

Last year, Buffet said the firm bought back some of the derivatives, reducing its exposure. Given the fragile nature of markets in the current environment, it may consider buying some more rather than betting on equities staving off another correction.
