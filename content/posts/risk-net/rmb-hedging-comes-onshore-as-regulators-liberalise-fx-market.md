> _Foreign investors turn to CNY for bond hedges as rule changes spur more competition_

Investors are increasingly hedging the foreign exchange exposures from their Chinese bond portfolios in the onshore market, following recent rule changes that have opened the market up to more competition.

Banks say hedging costs have fallen as a direct result of legislation passed in January to allow foreign investors to hedge currency risk arising from exposure to the onshore interbank bond market directly with domestic institutions rather than going via a custodian bank. An initiative in May to launch a prime brokerage system for FX hedging is likely to bring costs down further.

“Allowing foreign institutional investors to use up to three local counterparties for hedging purposes, rather than going through a custodian, has helped lower costs by introducing competition, thus increasing the attractiveness of hedging onshore,” says one director at a US bank in Hong Kong.

He estimates that 30–40% of foreign investors with renminbi exposures have been hedging in the onshore CNY market this year, compared with 20–30% for the same period last year.

Foreign participation in China’s fixed income market has been growing steadily since 2017, when Bond Connect was launched to allow access to the interbank market via Hong Kong. Participation has also been boosted by index providers such as JP Morgan and Bloomberg incorporating the country’s interbank bond market into their emerging market indexes.

The alternative to the custodian banks is to hedge using the offshore CNH rate as a proxy. The basis between CNH and CNY fluctuates but has been elevated since the start of 2020, before it retraced in June (see figure). As of June 23, the basis was around 13 pips.

Lillian Tao, head of institutional client group macro sales for China at Deutsche Bank, says the basis can be enough to encourage foreigners tapping into China’s CNY-denominated bond market – especially real money investors – to turn to CNY to minimise basis risk.

“Whilst CNH and CNY might be technically fungible, the relationship is not strictly one-to-one, so a lot of our clients want to use onshore curve to make sure currency basis is consistent,” says Tao.

Ken Peng, head of Asia investment strategy at Citi Private Bank, says the CNH market is also too small to support further development of the domestic bond market.

“Additional onshore hedging capacity is critical to further development of the bond market,” says Peng.

According to the latest data from China Central Depository and Clearing and Shanghai Clearing House – the country’s main bond-clearing organisations – foreigners owned just over 2.4 trillion yuan ($340 billion) of assets in China’s bond market, which equates to a little more than 2.3% of the total market. Some expect foreign ownership of Chinese fixed income assets will increase to 10% of the market in the coming years.

### Prime brokerage access

Meanwhile, hedging costs are expected to fall further as the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (Cfets), which provides trading facilities for the interbank bond and FX markets, launches a prime brokerage system that will give foreign investors access to more liquidity providers in the CNY interbank market, opening up more price competition for FX spot and derivatives markets.

In its May announcement, Cfets said prime brokerage will be available for both the interbank dollar/renminbi FX market and the interbank G10 currency pairs market, although for renminbi it can only be used to manage currency exposure arising from investment in China’s interbank bond market.

There are 30 market-makers and five trial market-makers for spot USD/CNY in Cfets, each of which will be eligible to apply for prime brokerage status. There are more than 700 market participants in Cfets for spot USD/CNY in total. Cfets assesses trading activities and volumes of these market-makers every two years. Trial market-makers have a lower volume threshold.

“With the establishment of the prime brokerage scheme, foreign non-bank institutional investors will potentially enjoy best execution with minimal infrastructure set-up,” says Tao.

“It is a positive step towards further aligning onshore FX with international conventions,” she adds.

### Not for everyone

Onshore hedging is not for everyone, though. Some asset managers may choose to remain unhedged and take the currency risk if they expect a stronger renminbi in the future and hedging costs are deemed too high.

Dutch pension fund asset manager APG considers its investments in China to be too small to incur the costs of hedging.

“We don’t hedge against the currency risk, because only a very small percentage of the total portfolio of our clients is exposed to this risk. Unless you have a very outspoken directional view, it’s not necessary to do so,” says Thijs Aaten, chief finance and risk officer at APG Asset Management Asia.

“And that’s the same approach that we are taking with other emerging market currencies, because hedging emerging market currencies is quite expensive,” he says.

At the end of last year, APG earmarked just €75 million ($84.5 million) for investing in the country’s fixed income market – a tiny fraction of its total €462.5 billion ($521.4 billion) assets-under-management worldwide.

Asset managers often have to decide whether they want that currency exposure and make a determination about whether they are overexposed to certain currencies, says Aaten, adding that, for the time being, APG is not.
