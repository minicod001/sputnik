On March 27, in the middle of the worst economic crisis in generations, Europe’s securities regulator published a proposal that, according to one hedge fund lobbyist, could upend the business models of scores of firms.

Others predict less drastic impact from the [guidelines](https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma34-39-967_consultation_paper_on_guidelines_on_art_25_aifmd.pdf) on regulatory leverage limits for hedge funds, private equity and real estate funds, and other alternative investment funds (AIFs). But most people in the industry agree the proposal by the European Securities and Markets Authority needs changes.

The Esma paper sets out steps for national authorities, or NCAs, to follow when determining whether to cap the leverage of an AIF in their jurisdiction, in order to prevent the build-up of systemic risk. The power to impose such limits already exists – enshrined in the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), in force since 2013 – although no national regulator has ever used it.

Jiří Król, deputy chief executive of the Alternative Investment Management Association, says the fact that national regulators already have the power to impose leverage limits does not mean firms should not worry about whether it will be exercised appropriately.

“You’re capable of disrupting businesses or entire strategies. If you say relative value arbitrage can have at most two times leverage on a gross notional basis, you can’t run a relative value arbitrage strategy with that,” he says, referring to one of the two main measures of AIF leverage used in Europe.

Król draws a parallel with governments around the world shutting down their economies to prevent the spread of Covid-19: “Of course, public policy has certain tools but those tools need to be used in conjunction with a sophisticated and hopefully empirical assessment of how they’re helping and at which point they’re no longer helping, and weighing the costs and benefits of that public action.”

For Król, and for others in the industry, it is an open question whether leverage in AIFs amplifies systemic risk in the first place.

Leonard Ng, partner at law firm Sidley Austin, argues Esma should identify the link between the two before pressing ahead. “The way Esma is asking the questions suggests they haven’t made that link clearly,” he says, pointing to the fact that the regulator includes private equity funds in the scope of its proposal. “Private equity funds are often not themselves leveraged because the leverage, if any, happens at the level of the portfolio companies held by the funds.”

Stéphane Janin, head of regulation at Axa Investment Managers, says existing European regulations for the broader fund sector have “worked rather well” during the market turmoil. “We’ve had very few fund failures, especially in countries where you have many fund liquidity management tools,” he notes.

Regulators, for their part, suggest that funds do not need to fail to create systemic risk. According to Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor for financial stability at the Bank of England, margin calls and an inability to roll over funding forced leveraged hedge funds to sell almost $90 billion of government bonds in March as prices tumbled, which in turn put further pressure on prices.

“One important element in the amplification of liquidity pressure appears to have been the unwinding of large positions in interest rate markets, particularly US Treasuries, by very highly leveraged hedge funds,” Cunliffe said in a recent [speech](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2020/financial-system-resilience-lessons-from-a-real-stress-speech-by-jon-cunliffe.pdf?la=en&hash=68025EDB90D936B24560429761646BFEAE2D2D74).

But even assuming that fund leverage threatens financial stability, critics see other problems with Esma’s proposed guidelines: they say there are inconsistencies in both the calculations and the underlying data used to measure leverage, and that the guidelines capture too many funds.

### Skipping a step

Currently, European AIFs set their own leverage limits. Esma’s draft guidelines lay out a two-step process for national regulators to follow when assessing whether a fund’s leverage is a source of systemic risk.

Under step one, NCAs should first identify funds with “substantial” leverage, defined in the AIFMD as more than three times their net asset value under the commitment method. Unlike the gross method, this measure takes into account netting and hedging. Regulators should then turn to funds that do not use substantial leverage but which manage more than €500 million ($561 million) in regulatory assets, and lastly to other leveraged funds that may pose risks to financial stability

Funds identified under step one should be examined further under step two, using a number of indicators, as well as a qualitative assessment and judgement, to decide whether their leverage should be capped.

The rules target both financial leverage, which includes securities financing transactions and borrowing, and synthetic leverage, through the use of derivatives.

When the guidelines were released, Esma chair Steven Maijoor said they aimed to ensure NCAs adopted a consistent approach to assessing leverage-related systemic risk.

But to do that, Esma must first harmonise the way AIF leverage is measured in the European Union, according to the industry.

“There are still basic differences in calculation approaches,” says Bill Prew, chief executive at Indos Financial, a provider of depository and oversight services for AIFs. For instance, in some countries the leverage calculation under the commitment method includes cash in the fund’s base currency, whereas in others it is excluded, he says.

In its annual statistical [report](https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50-165-1006_asr-aif_2020.pdf) on EU AIFs published in January, Esma itself said the leverage data [report](https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50-165-1006_asr-aif_2020.pdf)ed by funds under the AIFMD was of such patchy quality that the regulator was unable to use it. In one example it gave, some firms used monetary values instead of percentages. In its March proposal, Esma again acknowledged problems with [report](https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50-165-1006_asr-aif_2020.pdf)ed data.

Janin at Axa Investment Managers gives another example and suggests a solution: “NCAs in different jurisdictions don’t ask for data from AIF managers in the same format – for example, some NCAs ask for the leverage figure as a percentage, so 100% would be expressed as 100, while others for the resulting calculation, meaning 1 in the same case.

“How can European bodies consolidate that? As a first step, Esma should get national regulators to agree among themselves on the same data formats and it should make it binding.”

Esma’s goal of achieving consistency across Europe is also threatened by Britain’s departure from the EU. The UK accounts for 80% of the European hedge fund industry by net assets and hedge funds are by far the largest users of leverage among AIFs. In last year’s statistical [report](https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50-165-748_aif_report_2019.pdf), Esma wrote that hedge fund leverage was “very high”, while the use of leverage by other AIFs was “limited”.

Ng at Sidley Austin says: “How fund leverage should be looked at and whether leverage is or is not relevant to financial stability could be something on which the UK diverges from the EU over time, because it’s not directly related to investor protection – it’s not the same as saying investors in the UK get less protection than, let’s say, German investors.”

However, Janin argues that, if the UK wants to be granted equivalence by the EU, “it might be in their interest to comply as far as possible with what is adopted by Esma”.

He adds: “For cross-border players between the UK and the EU, it will also be easier if the two regimes are aligned.”

### Gold-plating

There is more agreement in the industry on the scope of Esma’s proposal, described as “too wide” and “over-inclusive”.

Adina Gurau Audibert, head of asset management at the AFG, which represents investment funds based in France, thinks NCAs should examine only those funds that are both substantially leveraged, as defined in the AIFMD, and manage more than €1 billion in assets.

“Smaller funds are unlikely to have an impact on systemic risk,” she says.

France is Europe’s biggest hub for AIFs by number of funds and second-biggest by net assets.

Janin suggests limiting the scope to funds with the so-called substantial leverage, “to be more consistent” with the approach laid out by the International Organization of Securities Commissions in December.

“We should avoid having European gold-plating as compared with what Iosco asked for in December 2019,” he says. “It is about keeping Europe competitive, as well as a question of consistency of rules around the world for global players like us.”

In its December [paper](https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD645.pdf), Iosco wrote that regulators should focus on funds that are “more likely” to pose risks to the financial system through their leverage, although the organisation did not specify a particular level of leverage.

Similarly, Ng finds it “a bit odd” that, in a paper focused on the systemic risk stemming from leverage, Esma also wants national regulators to look at AIFs that are not particularly leveraged.

Esma’s consultation runs until September 1.
