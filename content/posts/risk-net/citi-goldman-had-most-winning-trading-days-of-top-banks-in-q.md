The three months to end-June saw some top Wall Street dealers score their highest quarterly number of profit-making trading days for more than half a decade.

Among systemic US banks, Citi and Goldman Sachs led with 45 winning trading days apiece, their highest quarterly totals in at least five years, when public disclosure began.

In aggregate, the eight US systemic firms reported 314 profit-making days over Q2, around 39 each on average. This compares with 296 profit-making days in Q1.

Top dealers Bank of America, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley had 43, 37 and 43 winning days each. Wells Fargo posted 30 profit-making days. Custody banks BNY Mellon and State Street disclosed 35 and 36 days with trading gains, respectively.

Not one of the eight banks reported a trading day on which losses exceeded their respective value-at-risk estimates over the quarter. This is a stark contrast from Q1, when there were [42 such days in aggregate.](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7545611/systemic-us-banks-incurred-42-var-breaches-in-q1)

### What is it? 

US banks and intermediate holding companies subject to federal regulators’ market risk capital rule must record the total number of trading days each calendar quarter that they incur a trading loss in their FFIEC 102 reports, which are used to vet firms’ analyses of their market risks.

Trading losses exclude fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading profit or loss.

### Why it matters

Huge trading windfalls powered the second-quarter earnings of Wall Street’s top dealers, helping to offset the jaw-dropping amount of [provisions for loan-losses](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7656216/systemic-us-banks-put-aside-35bn-for-credit-losses-in-q2) taken in expectation of a prolonged pandemic-induced recession.

Q2 net trading revenues at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7666226/goldman-breached-var-limit-16-times-in-h1) hit $7.2 billion, up 93% year-on-year, and at Citi $6.9 billion, a 48% increase. These blockbuster results came at the price of far higher [VAR levels](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7656221/trading-risks-lurched-higher-at-top-us-dealers-in-q2), which translate into increased market risk capital requirements.

The banks will be happy to wear the greater capital burden only for as long as returns justify the investment. If trading revenues fall from last quarter’s record highs, [as anticipated](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7655021/var-doubles-at-jp-morgan-in-q2), then the banks are also likely to wrestle their market risk levels back down to earth to avoid onerous capital charges. Calmer markets following the pandemic-induced tumult of March and April should also help dial down trading desks’ capital consumption.
