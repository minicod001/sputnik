> _Uncertainty surrounds scenario design and impact on stress capital buffer, dividends_

With US capital stress-test results less than a week away, uncertainty over how the Federal Reserve will adjust its assessments to reflect the Covid-19 economic crisis, and the impact this decision will have on banks’ capital plans, is causing sector-wide anxiety.

The comprehensive capital analysis and review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Stress Test (DFAST) results are due to be published on June 25, 2020.

Covid-19 “sensitivity analyses” will be appended to the Fed’s CCAR assessments, but how the analyses will feature, whether the results will be made public, and what impact they will ultimately have on banks’ capital plans all remain unknown.

Coryann Stefansson, head of prudential capital policy at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, says the banks themselves are divided over how the Fed will present its findings, and how they will use the results of the sensitivity analyses.

“Some believe the Fed will just release the CCAR and DFAST results. Others think the Fed will release the CCAR results and then there will also be a part two, a CCAR plus Covid-19 sensitivity analysis,” says Stefansson.

The content of the Fed’s sensitivity analyses, their assumptions and the date of the balance sheet that will be tested have not been publicly confirmed by the Fed in detail. And the implications are causing even more consternation, as the analyses could be used by the Fed to guide policy on [dividend payments](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7522861/fed-missed-chance-to-curb-dividends-say-ex-supervisors) and capital buffers, which will have implications for the investor response.

Randal Quarles, the Fed vice-chair for supervision, may flesh out more detail on the coronavirus add-on in a speech today (June 19), but voices across the sector complain this comes too late.

One industry lobbyist says: “It’s less than six days away from the disclosure of the CCAR results, and that just doesn’t sit well with me, because right now the banking industry, from an equity markets perspective, is doing fine. It doesn’t need to be destabilised by disclosure that is neither abundantly transparent nor reasonable.”

Former regulators and academics argue banks should do everything to shore up capital – including suspending dividends. By contrast, bankers warn against moves that could weaken their share valuations, thereby making it harder to raise fresh capital if needed in an emergency.

### Modelling the unknown

Banks’ original CCAR submissions were made on April 6, 2020. The work on these bottom-up stress tests began before the lockdowns in response to Covid-19, and they were based on Fed scenarios issued to the banks in February.

“I don’t think the traditional CCAR and DFAST stress tests will tell us much of anything because they’re so outdated, because they’re based on 31 December balance sheets and the stresses envisioned are, in some cases, much [less severe](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7512191/fed-defies-coronavirus-to-push-ahead-with-stress-test) than we’re experiencing right now,” says Jeremy Kress, professor of finance at the University of Michigan. “All eyes are going to be on the sensitivity analyses.”

Quarles [indicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47yQMKkbfao) to a Congressional round table on May 13 that commercial real estate would be a particular focus of the sensitivity analyses, and Stefansson suggests leveraged lending may also feature. Industry sources believe the unemployment assumption in the add-on will be at least 20%, compared with 10% in the original CCAR scenarios.

Sources say the Fed has intimated that it would apply its Covid-19 add-on to a Q1 balance sheet and these results would also be presented to the banks on a confidential basis, while only the aggregate results would be made public.

Kress and Gregg Gelzinis, senior policy analyst for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, both argue that a credible approach would include public transparency to ensure the tests were sufficiently robust.

But if the Fed avoids publishing bank-by-bank results for the sensitivity analyses, this would reassure banks that are anxious about the communication of the coronavirus add-on. Lobby groups argue revealing the unvarnished results for individual banks could do more harm than good, given the draconian and speculative nature of the scenarios, as well as the fundamental unreliability of existing models to accurately test current circumstances.

“Because of government stimulus and credit accommodations, it is difficult and uncertain to use models based on historical data to extrapolate the relationship between the unemployment rate and loan losses,” says Francisco Covas, head of research at the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) lobby group.

The head of modelling at a US global systemically important bank agrees that the unprecedented nature of both the economy-wide shutdown and the scale of government intervention makes it very [difficult](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7511401/as-covid-snaps-credit-models-lenders-turn-to-stress-testing) to build a model or dataset to accommodate the Covid-19 scenario: “I think the idea that an institution could have figured that out in the course of two months is unrealistic.”

### Capital consequences?

Questions over the reliability of the results are all the more serious, because banks are also unclear on how the sensitivity analyses will feed into capital requirements. In this respect, coronavirus has amplified pre-existing [concerns](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7331026/feds-rush-to-complete-stress-buffer-likely-to-unnerve-banks) around the introduction of the stress capital buffer (SCB) this year.

The SCB is specific to each bank, with a minimum requirement of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, and a maximum calibrated based on the trough of capital depletion shown in the Fed’s top-down CCAR results for each bank.

Despite the complications created by the coronavirus, most sources believe Quarles will be reluctant to postpone or diverge from the original SCB plan, which has been a flagship innovation of his tenure. This leaves the question of whether the 2020 SCB will be based on the original – and now partly outdated – February scenarios, or the new Covid-19 add-on.

“Are they going to filter [sensitivity analyses] through to the SCB? Again, people have different views on that,” says Stefansson.

Bankers currently draw hope from testimony given by Fed chair Jerome Powell to the Senate Banking Committee on June 16. He told the committee: “We’re not looking to have our capital requirements be procyclical.”

This has been taken to imply that the Fed does not want to impose tougher capital requirements on the banks at the same time that they are being encouraged to [expand](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7522166/banks-fear-time-limit-on-fed-leverage-ratio-reprieve) their balance sheets to finance the economy until activity can return to normal.

“I don’t think [the coronavirus add-on] will have an impact on the official capital requirements, but what it could have an effect on is Fed policy,” says William Lang, managing director of the Promontory Financial Group consultancy and former head of supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

That could mean the add-on does not feed into the SCB, but the insights gleaned from the sensitivity analyses will affect dividend policy. Most sources believe the add-on will be a factor in determining whether dividends should be cut or suspended.

But they disagree as to whether this decision will be taken top-down from the Fed or from banks themselves. A chorus of former regulators, academics and public interest groups, joined by Minneapolis Fed chair Neel Kashkari, are urging the Fed to follow the decisions already taken in Europe, and impose mandatory restrictions on dividend payouts.

This argument appeared to be bolstered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation quarterly review of banks’ earnings, which [showed](https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2020/pr20069.html#:~:text=Quarterly%20Net%20Income%20Fell%20by%2069.6%20Percent%20from%20First%20Quarter,percent)%20from%20a%20year%20ago.) banks paying out twice as much income in dividends as they retained for their capital in the first quarter, despite net income falling 70% across all banks.

The BPI’s Covas says the headline figures are potentially misleading: “Because the FDIC data only includes data on insured commercial banks and not bank holding companies, nearly 90% of dividends quoted in the report represent dividends from the bank subsidiary to the parent, not dividends to banks’ shareholders.”

Nonetheless, the Center for American Progress’s Gelzinis thinks there is a 50/50 chance the Fed will unilaterally suspend dividends – in which case, the SCB is less relevant.

“The buffer is a capital requirement above minimum capital requirements, and once you breach the buffer, the penalty is [restricting](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7501576/the-feds-stress-capital-buffer-relaxed-but-not-relaxing) capital distributions to a percentage of your eligible retained earnings. So, once you suspend capital distributions, the buffer is a moot point,” says Gelzinis.

Conversely, some industry sources suggest the Fed may give banks the opportunity to run the sensitivity analyses internally after June 25, with the option to present revised capital plans to the Fed in the third quarter. That would imply banks being encouraged to rethink their dividends themselves if the Covid-19 add-on shows serious capital depletion, rather than facing mandatory decisions imposed by the Fed.
