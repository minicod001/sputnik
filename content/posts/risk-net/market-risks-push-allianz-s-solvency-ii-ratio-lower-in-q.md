Heightened market risks over the second quarter added €2.7 billion ($3.2 billion) to Allianz’s solvency capital requirement (SCR), contributing to a three-percentage point drop in its core solvency ratio.

The German insurer’s Solvency II ratio, its SCR divided by eligible own funds, fell to 187% over the three months to end-June, its lowest level since Q3 2016. The SCR increased a net 5% to €43.2 billion over the quarter, outpacing a 3% rise in own funds, to €80.7 billion.

The build-up of the market risk component of the insurer’s SCR was partly offset by management actions and diversification effects, which shaved €600 million from the overall charge.

### What is it?

Under Solvency II, an insurer’s solvency ratio is the ratio of eligible own funds to its solvency capital requirement. The latter is calculated as the amount of own-funds needed for the insurer to honour policyholder obligations after a one-in-200-year stress event.

### Why it matters

Market risk makes up the largest chunk of Allianz’s SCR – [42%](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/investor-relations/en/results-reports/sfcr/2020/EN-Allianz-Group-SFCR-2019.pdf) of its undiversified components as of December 2019. Changes to market conditions, therefore, have an outsized influence on its Solvency II ratio.

In particular, the insurer cited lower risk-free rates and a tightening of credit spreads as responsible for the market SCR impacts. The firm also said that the [volatility adjustment](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7544171/aegon-allianz-solvency-ii-ratios-diverge-under-coronavirus-stress), a regulatory tool supposed to ameliorate the effects of short-term volatility on bond portfolios, decreased last quarter as markets calmed down, contributing to the SCR uplift.

More important to Allianz’s long-term prospects is not the SCR, but its own funds. The firm’s earnings generated just €2.4 billion of capital over Q2, compared with €3.4 billion the same quarter a year ago. A prolonged Covid recession could continue to sap income, leading to the steady erosion of its solvency ratio.
