> _BlackRock’s co-head of risk discusses challenges facing firms today, including compliance and op risks_

Ahead of the Risk Live in-person event, rescheduled for November, Risk.net is running a selection of key sessions online between June 30 and July 3.

In this presentation, Edward Fishwick, global co-head of risk and quantitative analysis at BlackRock, discusses the evolution of buy-side risk management over the past decade.

The biggest change, Fishwick argues, is the diversity of challenges facing firms today, including numerous new regulations, the rise of private assets and the modelling of risks linked to sustainable investing.

Operational risk has also moved up the agenda, especially for passive investment funds, which are less concerned about market risk, and the approach to managing op risk has become more quantitative, Fishwick says. Meanwhile, the importance of reducing operational errors has grown as fees have come under sustained pressure, he notes.
