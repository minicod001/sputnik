> _Proposal faced opposition from smaller broker-dealer members of US Treasuries CCP_

A US regulator has given the green light for the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation to implement a $74 billion liquidity facility for its US Treasury and repo clearing house.

The final [decision](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/ficc/2017/34-82090.pdf) was made by the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 15 and concludes an ongoing back-and-forth between the regulator, the DTCC and some [disgruntled](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5292066/dtccs-74-billion-liquidity-charge-riles-members) members of the firm’s clearing house, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC).

“DTCC is pleased the SEC has approved the Capped Contingency Liquidity Facility proposal. Once implemented, CCLF will provide a reasonable and effective means to further limit systemic risk in the marketplace, meeting the commission’s requirement for a committed liquidity resource,” says a DTCC spokesperson.

The $74 billion liquidity facility is designed to help the FICC – a subsidiary of the DTCC and the sole central counterparty for US Treasury trades and repos – survive the default of its largest clearing member. Under the new rule, FICC members must commit funding for the CCLF in proportion to the amount of liquidity risk they bring into the clearing house, based on their peak historical liquidity requirement over a six-month retrospective period.

This means FICC members engaging in repo and arbitrage strategies will probably see the biggest liquidity calls, which prompted firms such as Aardvark Securities, ICBC, LiquidityEdge, Ronin Capital, Rosenthal Collins Group and Wedbush Securities to [write](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-ficc-2017-002/ficc2017002.htm) letters to the SEC arguing against the proposal.

Nasdaq, which runs US Treasuries trading platform Nasdaq Fixed Income, formerly known as eSpeed, [also criticised](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-ficc-2017-002/ficc2017002-2662402-161432.pdf) the facility on November 1, arguing that the SEC should defer any decision on the CCLF until “more pressing” matters were considered that present “greater systemic risk”.

“The… FICC proposal will impact, perhaps dramatically, the ecosystem that the Treasury department has already singled out as needing further study and reform. In fact, the proposal reaches the heart of the matter that most concerned Treasury, namely the allocation of costs and fees on FICC members as well as the resulting incentives and conduct of non-FICC members,” said Theodore Bragg, vice-president of strategic planning at Nasdaq, in a comment letter to the SEC.

Firms that had commented on the original proposal either declined or were unavailable to comment for this story.

Wrangling with a vocal minority of the FICC’s 160-firm membership has been ongoing since at least 2015 when members [got wind](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2435384/treasury-repos-may-hit-20bp-under-dtcc-liquidity-plan) of an original $50 billion liquidity facility, prompting concerns about a repo price hike.

The government securities division of the FICC announced its plan to establish a CCLF on March 1, 2017, with a decision set to be made no later than September 16. That decision was delayed until November 15 to give SEC commissioners more time to evaluate the proposal.

In granting approval, the SEC noted that rule change was “consistent” with the SECExchange Act, which requires that the rules of a clearing agency “be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest”.

The go-ahead brings the DTCC in line with the Principles for financial market infrastructures, which were issued by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organization of Securities Commissions in 2012. Derivatives clearing houses have also implemented requirements similar to the CCLF, but the obligations are typically much smaller.

In a recent [interview](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5354751/dtccs-bodson-on-blockchain-sdrs-and-repo-clearing) with Risk.net, DTCC chief executive Michael Bodson defended the CCLF and the impact it could have on smaller FICC members.

“Everyone has a different operating model, and we’re sensitive to the concerns raised by the smaller non-bank broker-dealers,” he said. “At the same time, how do you portion out liquidity requirements? To simply give someone a pass because it’s more expensive for you as a result of your business model, that is also unfair on everyone else who is on the other side of the trade. It’s a price to pay to gain access.”

The DTCC hopes that an initiative with Digital Asset Holdings to develop a distributed ledger system for repo clearing, which would allow same-day netting of overnight trades, could in time reduce the $74 billion liquidity facility. A completion date for this project is unknown, however.
