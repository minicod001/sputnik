{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Traders say volatility of discount rate should be taken into account after "unprecedented" 12bp move_{{< /quote >}}

Traders say the pricing of euro interest rate swaps might need to change after an “unprecedented” jump in the overnight unsecured lending rate exposed the fragility of one of the key inputs.

The euro overnight index average (Eonia) fixing moved 33% higher over two days last week, leaping from –36 basis points on November 28 to –24bp on November 30. Rates strategists have blamed the move on extra lending linked to a sovereign debt swap in Greece, or an accounting change by a US bank. Eonia fell back to –29bp the following day.

Eonia is the rate at which the present value of future cashflows on euro interest rate swaps are discounted, and is a key input into the price of a new trade. Traders say the bout of volatility should now be priced in to reflect the increased fixing risk of euro interest rate swaps.

“It’s very simple: spreads on swaps referencing three-month Eonia now need to be wider than they were before,” says Eske Smidt, head of global rates at Danske Bank in Copenhagen.

“What happened was unprecedented. Before you would not have expected, in your wildest imagination, Eonia could move like that. Now people will have to build a risk premium into their swaps to account for the fact it could happen again,” he adds.

Another euro swaps trader agrees, in principle, that some form of risk premium should now be added. But he thinks competitive forces will limit the impact on prices.

“In fairness, Eonia should probably trade a bit wider the more volatile the index is,” says Lauri Snäll, head of euro swaps trading at Nordea Markets in Copenhagen. “However, competition for flow is fierce and that will keep bid-offers tight.”

### Eonia vulnerable

The wild move demonstrates how sensitive Eonia has become to random, irregular quotes – the result of falling volumes in underlying loan markets.

The unsecured overnight lending volumes in euro, measured by Eonia, have fallen off considerably in recent years, partly as a result of the European Central Bank’s ultra-loose monetary policies.

With lending volumes especially low at month-end last week – down to €4.2 billion ($4.9 billion) per day from an average of €7 billion – it would have taken a relatively small number of outlying transactions to skew the rate on that date. By comparison, the average daily transaction volume underpinning the reformed sterling overnight index average is £39.4 billion.

“These high fixings we have seen over the past few days underscores just how vulnerable Eonia has become in its current form,” says Michael Leister, head of interest rate strategy at Commerzbank in London. “Low volumes and the low number of contributing banks increases the risk that one outlier can distort the whole rate.”

The future of Eonia had already been [called into question](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5338931/europes-eonia-dilemma) in recent months, with some swaps traders arguing it is no longer representative of the market it is supposed to measure.

A review of transaction data is currently being undertaken by the rate’s administrator, the European Money Market Institute, to identify ways it can be bolstered, such as broadening the scope of eligible transactions.

However, in September it was revealed the ECB plans to develop an alternative unsecured overnight transaction rate, based on its own money market statistical reporting data, which it has been collecting from European lenders since April 2016 to monitor the transmission of monetary policy decisions.

Given that the ECB has indicated the rate will be based on borrowing, observers say it should be more robust than Eonia, which is based on lending.

“You could say it is much more relevant to look at borrowing,” says Danske’s Smidt. “Because excess liquidity is so great, more is traded with banks on the bid side than the offer side – and that has been one of the reasons why Eonia volume is falling so much.”

### Periphery to blame?

In the meantime, theories are still circulating as to precisely what caused such a sharp spike at a time when most market indicators remained relatively calm. Other euro benchmarks stayed flat, including Euronia, the volume-weighted index of unsecured euro overnight cash transactions brokered in London by contributing Wholesale Markets Brokers’ Association member firms.

“It caused some confusion because it just looks like that number and not much else has materially moved; stress looks different to this,” says Philipp de Cassan, head of euro flow rates trading at Nomura in London.

Commerzbank’s Leister was also surprised when he first saw the scale of the Eonia move. “Initially a lot of people were speculating it was just a fat finger or data error,” he says. “But Emmi then quickly clarified everything is correct.”

One theory is the spike was caused by borrowing activity among smaller panel members, thanks to the recent Greek debt swap.

Greece last week offered to swap 20 outstanding sovereign bonds for five new benchmark ones, as part of a refinancing exercise. Banks in Europe’s periphery that participated in the tender were then left with fewer bonds to use for financing in the repo market or the weekly main refinancing operations operated by the ECB.

According to the theory, the banks consequently looked to bridge the funding requirement in the Eonia market until the new bonds are issued on December 5. But, unable to borrow at the same rate as banks that typically borrow in that market, the transactions pushed Eonia higher.

“This might explain why,” says de Cassan. “Some banks in the periphery might be accessing the Eonia market for a couple of days.”

The ECB’s recent consultation reveals that roughly 95% of interbank lending turnover is generated by the top 10 banks in the euro area. That leaves a reference rate, which measures unsecured lending, vulnerable to events that draw new banks – which are unable to borrow at the same rates – into the unsecured overnight market.

A December 1 [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-01/eonia-surge-mystery-may-be-result-of-excess-greek-bank-liquidity) highlighted an alternative theory, that the National Bank of Greece – an Eonia panel member – had around €450 million in excess liquidity, which it lent to peers at rates higher than the normal Eonia fixing.

“The €4 billion [Eonia volume] normally come from higher quality names, and they achieve an average rate of –36bp,” says de Cassan. “But if there’s €100 or €200 million trading at zero overnight, that could change the average.”

A third theory, referenced in a December 5 note by Nomura rates strategist Renuka Fernandez, suggests that a US financial institution might have switched its year-end accounting period from December 31 to November 30, which generated a sudden need for short-term liquidity. The additional demand may have pushed the Eonia rate higher.
