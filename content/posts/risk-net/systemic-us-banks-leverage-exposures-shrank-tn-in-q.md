US systemic lenders’ leverage exposures dropped by 10% over the three months to end-June, the effect of a temporary change to regulatory capital rules passed by the Federal Reserve on [April 1](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20200401a1.pdf).

The relief allows US banks subject to the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) rule to [exempt](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7522166/banks-fear-time-limit-on-fed-leverage-ratio-reprieve) US Treasury securities and excess reserves held at the Fed from their exposure measures. This affects the quantity of on-balance sheet assets that count towards the denominator of the SLR.

At JP Morgan, on-balance sheet exposures fell 13% quarter-on-quarter, or $293 billion. Citi’s fell $227.3 billion (-13%), Wells Fargo’s $192.6 billion (-11%), Bank of America’s $173.7 billion (-8%), Morgan Stanley’s $140.9 billion (-20%), Goldman Sachs’ $112.1 billion (-16%), BNY Mellon’s $89.8 billion (-27%), and State Street’s $76.6 billion (-36%).
