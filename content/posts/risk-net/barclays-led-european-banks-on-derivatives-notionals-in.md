UK giant Barclays held the most derivatives notionals among Europe’s largest banks in 2019, overtaking Deutsche Bank, which has been drastically shrinking its systemic footprint as part of a [firm-wide restructure](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7196271/now-less-of-a-systemic-risk-deutsche-wins-capital-relief).

The amount of over-the-counter derivatives notionals outstanding at the UK lender increased 7% over 2019 to €33.89 trillion, systemic risk data published by the [European Banking Authority (EBA)](https://eba.europa.eu/eba-updates-data-used-identification-global-systemically-important-institutions-g-siis) shows. Notionals at Deutsche, meanwhile, fell a whopping 10% on end-2018, from €35.23 trillion to €31.83 trillion.

The two banks accounted for 14.6% and 13.8%, respectively, of all notionals held by the 37 largest banks in Europe.

Notionals at ABN Amro dropped the most over the year of this group, plummeting 41.6% to €1.44 trillion. Swedbank and HSBC posted drops of 29.2% to €478.8 billion and 16.3% to €23.37 trillion, respectively.

At the other end of the spectrum, exposures at Commerzbank surged 65% year-on-year, although with a notional portfolio size of €4.42 trillion, it remains a mid-league dealer. France’s Crédit Agricole posted a 42.3% increase to €9.74 trillion.

### What is it?

The European Banking Authority gathers data from the bloc’s 37 largest banks by leverage exposure to gauge individual firms’ systemic riskiness.

This is used to populate 12 systemic indicators spread across five broad categories: size; interconnectedness; substitutability; complexity and cross-jurisdictional activity.

The data is then submitted to the Basel Committee, contributing to the identification of global systemically-important banks (G-Sibs).

Total notional amount of OTC derivatives is one of the 12 indicators, and includes instruments cleared through a central counterparty and those settled bilaterally.

German landesbank Helaba was added to the list in 2019.

### Why it matters

Top banks have generally slimmed their derivatives portfolios over the years following the introduction of enhanced supervision and capital add-ons for G-Sibs. Cutting notionals, through portfolio compression or other means, is a quick and easy way to shrink their systemic footprints.

Deutsche has focused on offloading derivatives exposures as part of its [restructuring](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/banks/7660656/deutsche-slashed-bad-bank-rwas-in-h1) , and over the seven years to end-2019 has reduced its portfolio some 36%. This has helped lower its G-Sib score and, in consequence, reduce the associated capital add-on.

Many European dealers will see their derivatives notionals spike this year, however, as a consequence of the coronavirus crisis and the raging demand for swaps and other hedges from the corporates and financial institutions that make up the G-Sibs’ client base.

This may result in a handful of banks increasing their G-Sib scores, and having to assume larger capital add-ons.
