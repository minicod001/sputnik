> _OpRisk North America: Swiss bank has taken action to prevent a repeat of costly missteps_

UBS is hoping its regulators will reduce the level of operational risk capital it must hold against past losses under the forthcoming standardised measurement approach (SMA), according to James Oates, UBS’s global head of compliance and operational risk control.

Speaking at the OpRisk North America conference in New York yesterday (March 20), Oates set out how the bank had [systematically overhauled](https://www.risk.net/awards/2460195/bank-year-ubs) its operational risk and compliance function in a bid to prevent a repeat of costly missteps – from the [Kweku Adoboli](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/operational-risk/2349236/how-ubs-reacted-adoboli-losses) rogue trading case to its involvement in the forex and Libor benchmark-rigging scandals – which have harmed its reputation and driven up its operational-risk-weighted assets.

Under the forthcoming switch to the standardised approach to measuring op risk capital (SMA), the amount of capital a bank must hold is [skewed](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/5298676/u-turn-on-sma-comparability-sparks-anger) by the losses it has suffered over the past decade. However, a compromise clause inserted into the [Basel III framework](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/5371581/basel-iii-final-op-risk-framework-leaves-banks-guessing) allows national regulators to let banks under their jurisdiction ignore the impact of past losses from their calculations – significantly reducing their overall op risk capital requirement.

Asked whether UBS hoped to benefit from this clause, Oates said: “That’s the million-dollar question – maybe even billion-dollar question, actually. We are engaging in that very question with our regulators.”

Even if the bank’s regulators decide not to show clemency, several of its largest fines will have rolled off by the time the SMA is implemented from 2022, Oates pointed out, such as the $780 million settlement with US regulators relating to criminal charges that it helped clients avoid paying taxes made in 2009.

“I think the time horizon certainly helps, in terms of when [past losses] roll off. Some of our big losses are early on in that cycle. But we are keen to work with our stakeholders to figure out a way of [assessing]: what’s the real root cause of some of those losses, and can we demonstrate for some of the businesses we are no longer in or have exited, that we’ve not only exited the businesses, we’ve exited the root causes associated with those losses as well?” he said.

That is easier said than done, Oates noted. Several banks have [struggled](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/operational-risk/5318991/credit-suisse-seeks-capital-relief-for-resolution-unit) to convince regulators that, though they have divested business lines, they should no longer be forced to hold op risk capital against them.

UBS has certainly taken its medicine in terms of overhauling its risk culture, though. Curing its op risk problems required a complete change of focus for the bank, said Oates. In recent years, the lender has reorganised its risk and compliance functions, devised a new firm-wide risk taxonomy, revamped its risk and control assessments, and stepped up its monitoring of employee behaviour and conduct.

But it was its implication in the Libor scandal which brought home that the bank’s approach to operational risk was aimed at the wrong target – mistakes, rather than malice, said Oates.

“We were very focused on end-of-day controls – trade confirmation, profit and loss and so on. But we had one trader in Japan who had all his trades and P&L booked properly at the end of each day, but he tried to collude with someone at another bank – to try to get him to submit a price he didn’t believe in. Our control framework was not designed to stop people trying to commit a crime,” Oates said.

Cultural change was an early focus as the bank struggled to get beyond the scandals, Oates said, with a mindset change required of the bank’s compliance and operational risk functions which had missed the developing benchmark-rigging scandals.

“We found that most compliance officers believed their job was to have good policies in place for each regulation – and good compliance officers would also see that these policies were being followed. So they didn’t pay attention to unregulated markets. And when we asked why the operational risk function didn’t notice [the scandals], we found that operational risk saw itself mainly as a reporting function.”

But the biggest challenge was working with the concept of risk appetite. At first, Oates says, raising the subject met with a knee-jerk reaction that appetite for operational risk should be zero – “we can’t have another unauthorised trading incident”, he was told.

The result was to force business leaders to take ownership and accountability of operational risk, he said, and think about their risk tolerance in terms of appetite for controls. Exercises such as risk and control self-assessments, which op risk staff had been faithfully compiling, are best conducted against a defined risk appetite, Oates noted; without an appetite statement, there is no way to judge whether controls are adequate.

“If I had my life to do over again, I would have started with that risk appetite discussion very early on,” Oates said.
