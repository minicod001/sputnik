{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Banks dispute Fed paper showing accounting switch will lessen loan reserve procyclicality_{{< /quote >}}

US banks are taking issue with official sector research that concludes new accounting standards will likely reduce procyclicality in required loan-loss reserves.

A recent Federal Reserve [paper](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018020pap.pdf) concludes the forthcoming current expected credit loss ([CECL](https://www.risk.net/topics/current-expected-credit-loss-cecl)) accounting standard will generally lessen the degree to which reserves are overstated at the trough of an economic cycle and understated at its peak, compared with the current incurred loss standard, and depending on the forecast and modelling assumptions used.

The paper examines how provisioning under CECL would play out under three scenarios: an optimistic forecast, which anticipates steady month-over-month growth; a forecast that is optimistic during recoveries and pessimistic during downturns; and a scenario that assumes banks can only make forecasts two quarters into the future.

Although they admit the scenarios are stylised, the Fed authors still base their conclusions on the assumption that lenders will make reserve decisions based on a large degree of foresight into future economic conditions – something banks argue is unrealistic, and undermines their findings.

“A lot of people very strongly believe such an analysis is deeply flawed, because when you look at consensus economic forecasts versus what actually happened going into a downturn, you’ll see forecasts that understate what actually happens,” says the executive in charge of CECL at a large US regional bank.

The Fed declined to comment. The paper, written by a team led by Fed accountant Sarah Chae, represents the views of the authors, not the Fed board.

The paper’s conclusions cut to the heart of banks’ fears that that the switch to expected credit loss accounting regimes – CECL and its counterpart for non-US banks, International Financial Reporting Standard 9 – will increase the [volatility](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5189526/volatility-of-ifrs-9-loss-estimates-alarms-lenders) of loan-loss provisioning, complicating financial planning between quarters and [hitting](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/5303966/stage-fright-banks-tackle-ifrs-9-loan-loss-volatility) profit and loss statements and capital ratios.

Back in November 2016, when the European Banking Authority ran an impact assessment exercise, 75% of the banks that participated said they expected an increase in the volatility of loss provisions under IFRS 9.

The Fed paper [follows a study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2931474) by Bank for International Settlements economists Benjamin Cohen and Gerald Edwards that found that, if banks had responded immediately to warning signals about credit quality before the financial crisis, loan-loss provisioning would have increased substantially.

CECL, which takes effect from 2020, requires banks to set aside reserves to cover potential lifetime losses on loans whose probability of default rises between reporting periods, based on their own internal forecasts. Those forecasts are in turn based on ‘reasonable and supportable’ information – a phrase that banksargue lacks a [clear definition](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5452491/banks-grapple-with-ifrs-9-and-cecl-loan-loss-forecasting).

The amount of reserves banks set aside to cover lifetime expected losses hinges to a large extent on whether the macroeconomic assumptions they make about the future play out in reality – something that banks admit they do a bad job of.

“If you miss your economic forecast – which everyone does – you’re going to be piling on reserves late, right at the height of a crisis when you need liquidity,” says the head of risk analytics at another large regional US bank.

The BIS research appears to support the views of the Fed authors. It compares loan-loss provisions taken by banks before the financial crisis with those that would have been taken had IFRS 9 and CECL been in place. It constructs a “cyclical average” scenario that calculates the average amount of provisions taken each year in a sample of 100 large global banks as a share of loan growth, which is then augmented or reduced.

Under this scenario, provisions would have risen substantially in advance of the financial crisis in 2008. For the US banks, for example, they would have risen from 1.3% of gross loans in 2006 to 2.2%.

But, again, this analysis assumes that bankshave a large degree of foresight. “Since CECL will have to incorporate economic information and forecasts at the time the analysis is being done, I’ve been calling it a perfect forecast fallacy,” says the CECL executive. “It’s deeply flawed, and leads to conclusions that may be problematic.”

The Fed paper compares the path of loan loss provisions under the existing incurred loss standard with that of CECL in response to changes in California’s home price index between 2004 and 2012. As home prices started to weaken in 2006, banks did not smoothly increase provisions, but instead increased them in a volatile fashion after the market had bottomed out in 2009, with reserves reaching a peak at the trough of the recession.

Under CECL, and allowing foresight of future conditions, banks would have increased provisions smoothly from 2006, when probabilities of default began to rise, reaching a peak at the onset of the recession. In this sense, CECL would act to reduce procyclicality, argue the authors.

The Fed’s paper does acknowledge banks in practice don’t have perfect foresight, stating “in most cases, banks will not be able to perfectly assess macroeconomic conditions”.

Under the optimistic scenario, the authors observe provisions are similar to those under the incurred loss standard: both would have shown rapid build-up throughout 2008 and 2009 as home prices bottomed out. Under the second scenario, provisions largely mirror those under the optimistic scenario between 2007 and 2009 – but after 2009, there is a sudden increase as provisions are forecast to be much higher due to the continued weakening of home price forecasts.

### Anticipated changes

But even under the paper’s third scenario, which assumes banks have limited foresight – being able to accurately predict conditions only two quarters into the future – the authors find CECL would have been less procyclical than the incurred loss standard. This is because, they argue, banks would have increased or decreased reserves in response to anticipated changes in home prices, rather than relying solely on backward-looking information.

However, bankers say this reasoning is flawed, because lenders’ foresight is imperfect even two quarters ahead. Therefore – unless they happen to guess correctly – the new rules will still lead to them understating provisions going into a downturn and overstating them at the trough.

Banks have pointed out previously that the volatility of provisioning will also depend to an extent on the quality of their loan books; those with high-quality loans are less likely to see a steep rise in probabilities of default between reporting periods, versus those with loans already at risk of suffering a material downgrade.
