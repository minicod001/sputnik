A number of banks have reduced or stopped the funding of polluters in recent years. The reasons for such actions are complex, ranging from ethical concerns to political and shareholder pressure. Increasingly though, lenders are starting to think that it also makes good financial sense.

The 2015 Paris Agreement has raised the reputational costs of lending to carbon-heavy companies and accelerated a global move towards a low-carbon economy. But a newer pressure on banks to go green comes from the risk of losses on loans to firms with much to lose in the transition away from dirty energy.

“We’re already seeking to implement climate change risk in our customer evaluations and we’re trying to weave it into the architecture of our credit frameworks,” said Mathew Murphy, general manager of wholesale credit and head of social and environmental risk at Australian bank ANZ.

Murphy was speaking at a May 15 webinar introducing a [methodology](http://www.unepfi.org/publications/banking-publications/extending-our-horizons/) – developed by 16 banks and the United Nations (UN) – for evaluating credit risks arising from the low-carbon transition. The working group is also preparing a second report, covering methodologies for assessing physical climate risks, such as droughts and floods.

In parallel with this, several banks are developing their own quantitative approaches to climate-related credit risk. These early attempts are hampered by the sheer complexity of the task, a lack of data and organisational constraints but they represent the first steps towards robust modelling of climate risk.

The modellers are trying to gauge how individual corporate borrowers in the energy sector or how that sector as a whole will be affected by future environmental regulation – for example, a limit or tax on carbon dioxide emissions – and by lower demand for conventional fuels.

One of the problems is there is a myriad of scenarios in which a low-carbon economy could be achieved, with variables ranging from what future governments in different countries are likely to do to how the affected companies may evolve in response. And each path to keeping the global temperature this century no more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels – as pledged by governments in the Paris accord – would have a very different impact on a loan portfolio.

“There are multiple ways to achieve a 2°C scenario; each path can lead to vastly different sector impacts depending on the underlying scenario assumptions, such as the feasibility of wide-scale carbon capture and storage technology,” says the report by the UN working group, adding as another example that “in some scenarios, the oil and gas sector can benefit from a rapid phase-out of coal”.

### New risk, new approaches

At BNP Paribas (BNPP), the corporate and social responsibility (CSR) and risk teams are working on a pilot project to assess the impact of a potential carbon tax on the energy companies they lend to. The model assumes a certain level of a global carbon tax, which would have a similar impact to a restriction on emissions, rendering some projects economically unviable. “We want to find out if our portfolio is resilient and whether clients are resilient if there is a carbon tax in the future,” says Nathalie Jaubert, deputy head of CSR at the bank.

The aim of the model, which is currently being tested, is to work out which specific companies will stay within their emissions allowance at various points in time – and these will then be the companies the bank should have in its loan portfolio at those points. “We will follow this energy mix to make sure it’s in line with a two-degree scenario, and we will check it in 2020, 2025 and 2030,” Jaubert says.

At those points, if some companies are exceeding their carbon budget – calculated to keep overall global emissions in check – BNPP will engage with them to investigate the issue more thoroughly, she adds. One option would be to see whether the firm is diversifying into renewable power generation and whether it needs more time to implement the strategy. “Alternatively, we might stop working with a firm altogether,” says Jaubert (pictured).

Barclays carried out a similar pilot project focused on electricity markets in the US and Europe. The project sampled 35 utilities involved in the production, distribution and supply of power and compared each firm’s 2017 generation mix against projections of what the generation mix will be in 2030 and 2040, taking the firms’ plans into account.

“If the generation mix of the firm was higher carbon than the baseline [emissions allowed for the two-degree scenario], we classified them as high-carbon, and if below – as low-carbon,” said Tim Kök, vice-president of credit risk at Barclays, explaining the project at the May 15 webinar.

The team then worked out how much the firms would need to spend in order to put their businesses on the two-degree pathway and estimated the impact of this increased capital expenditure on the firms, which allowed them to calculate default probabilities. The results showed a significant increase in climate-related default risk among the companies in the bank’s portfolio by 2040 compared with 2017, albeit from a low base. The vast majority of firms in the portfolio remained investment-grade, Kök added.

These much longer timeframes for assessing borrowers’ creditworthiness, and the assessment’s impact on a bank’s actions are some of the particularly novel aspects of analysing climate-related credit risk. Banks are trying to understand which of their carbon-heavy clients will be creditworthy in 10 or 20 years from now rather than in three or five years, which is the traditional horizon for evaluating credit risk.

As the gradual energy transition is unlikely to affect the clients’ finances in the next three-five years, there is usually no reason to reduce lending to them now. But a bank may still want to do that in order to prod those firms into diversification – a multi-year process – so that they are creditworthy in the longer term.

### Data gaps

According to both Jaubert and Kök, it was a struggle to obtain all the data necessary for the projects. “Several utilities around the world do not specifically disclose their generation mix,” noted Kök. “This is vital information for us.”

Companies are increasingly being encouraged to disclose their emissions and other environmental data through initiatives such as the UK-based CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project. A not-for-profit organisation, the CDP gathers the data via an annual survey, covering some 650 companies around the world with assets totalling $87 trillion.

This year, the CDP introduced questions on companies’ climate-related plans – for example, investments in low-carbon technology research and development, says Tony Rooke, technical director at the charity. “What a firm is going to do is more indicative of how they will perform in a low-carbon economy than what they’ve done in the past,” he says. “So this gives a better idea of what a firm’s future emissions will be and therefore their resiliency to the low-carbon transition.”

CDP was a valuable source of data for BNPP’s project, Jaubert says, as were firms’ own public disclosures. The rest came down to discussions with clients. “We were lacking data from a lot of public companies and small companies,” she says.

Banks already have some data on corporate borrowers but much of it is of limited use for analysing climate risk.

“Bank data isn’t set up for assessing climate change impact,” said Simone Dettling, banking specialist at the UN, speaking at the webinar.“It isn’t sufficient to know that your counterparty is a car manufacturer. You need to know what kind of cars they make, [for example, whether it is] electric vehicles, where they are based and so on.” Knowing the location of the client is important for understanding how it may be affected by government policies and physical risks from climate change.

There is also a personnel issue: the discipline of climate risk modelling requires the input of people dispersed throughout the bank – from credit and sector experts to risk management and quantitative finance specialists – and few banks have a framework allowing them to work together.

However, as climate risk starts to be seen not just as a reputational or ethical concern but as an emerging financial risk, cooperation between CSR departments and risk desks is growing.

“Seven years ago, when BNPP’s CSR department was built, we were quite separate from risk,” Jaubert says. “We had a different, maybe complementary view from the risk department, usually more long-term and based on risks that are more difficult to quantify. Now, things have changed quite a lot.”

She says there is now a greater understanding of financial risk management within the CSR team enabling them to talk to the risk team in their own language. At the same time, the risk managers have become more used to working on other emerging risks, such as cyber security, which require a more creative approach than traditional risks.

### Good old ethics

Despite the improvements, the discipline of financial climate risk modelling is still [in its infancy](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5380376/banks-begin-to-model-climate-risk-in-loan-portfolios) and hard numbers are hard to produce. Therefore, for now, the old drivers of climate-related lending decisions – such as reputational and ethical considerations – remain important.

According to Jakob Thomä (pictured), a managing director at think-tank 2° Investing Initiative, these are the real reasons behind decisions by several banks, including BNPP and HSBC, over the last 18 months to stop working with carbon-intensive industries.

BNPP [said](http://www.bnpparibas.com.cn/en/2017/10/11/bnp-paribas-takes-further-measures-to-accelerate-its-support-of-the-energy-transition/) last October that it would no longer do business with companies whose main activities focus on oil and gas from shale or tar sands, following a previous decision to reduce its support for coal mines and coal-fired power generators.

“BNP Paribas is committed to bringing its financing and investment activities in line with the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenario, which aims to keep global warming below 2°C by the end of the century,” the bank said in a statement. “To achieve this goal, the world must reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, starting with oil and gas from shale and oil from tar sands whose extraction and production emits high levels of greenhouse gases and has harmful effects on the environment.”

As for coal mining, it is considered high-carbon mostly because, when burned for power generation, it emits almost twice the carbon dioxide of gas. This falls into coal miners’ so-called Scope 3 emissions – those from the use of sold products – according to [international standards](http://www.ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/ghgp/standards/Product-Life-Cycle-Accounting-Reporting-Standard_041613.pdf) on greenhouse gas accounting and reporting.

“The level of analytical rigour that underpins some of these announcements [by banks] is pretty limited,” Thomä says. “They are based more on a qualitative assessment looking at reputational gain. A very granular analysis would not result in a blanket ban of a sector.” For example, some coal firms may be economically viable in a low-carbon world because they are diversifying or are in a regulatory environment in which they would get government assistance, he explains.

However, Thomä believes a shift is happening: “What we’re seeing now is a transition from these decisions being driven by the CSR department towards banks looking at factoring this risk into their lending decisions.”
