> _New Esma guidance could still allow EU firms to trade Singapore stocks_

Hong Kong, Australia and South Africa are on track to get European Union equivalence for share trading under the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ([Mifid II](https://www.risk.net/topics/mifid)) by the year-end, according to a senior official at the European Commission. However, the EC’s director of financial markets, Ugo Bassi, made no reference to Singapore, which some have interpreted as a sign the city-state might not be among the first wave of equivalence decisions.

“We have just received [guidance] from Esma[European Securities and Markets Authority], which, luckily for us, suggests we only need to proceed with equivalence decisions for jurisdictions where the volume of trades requires, justifies and [makes it necessary](https://www.risk.net/our-take/5357846/esma-navigates-a-brexit-maze-over-equivalence) to adopt such a decision,” said Bassi. “Hong Kong, Australia, South Africa – these are the ones where we have to make sure a decision is adopted within the next 35 days. It will take a little longer for the other jurisdictions where [the volume of] trades [does] not require immediate action.”

Bassi was speaking on November 29, during a panel discussion at the annual Futures Industry Association (FIA) conference in Singapore. On the previous day, he had met with regulators and industry representatives behind closed doors.

A regulatory source who was present at one of these closed-door meetings confirmed Singapore is not viewed as a priority case for Mifid II equivalence. “[The EC] has only so much bandwidth to get the equivalence work done and is pleading for understanding… Singapore is not deemed to pose a material risk to the EU, so it is business as usual [and there is] no need to force it through the equivalence process,” says the source.

An official from Singapore’s SGX exchange had [previously expressed confidence](https://www.risk.net/regulation/mifid/5343846/sgx-expects-to-be-among-first-wave-of-mifid-ii-equivalence) that the venue would be among the first wave of equivalence decisions. Bassi said the EC “has been working night and day” to get equivalence decisions adopted ahead of the January 3 deadline, but it has been extremely challenging because of the complexity of different legislative systems in each country.

Carol Williamson, senior counsel, legal services at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), confirmed Hong Kong’s stock exchange is set to achieve equivalence.

“Following the consultation process between the regulator and the EC, our understanding is that Hong Kong will be getting equivalence imminently,” she said, speaking as part of a panel session at the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Asifma) 2017 Annual Conference in Hong Kong on November 29.

According to Williamson, the EC voted on granting Hong Kong equivalence status on November 24. “It will be interesting to see what the announcement actually says – whether it will just reference the stock exchange as an equivalent trading venue and not others that exist in Hong Kong,” she added.

### No derivatives equivalence

Even if Hong Kong, as a jurisdiction, does receive an equivalence decision, it will only apply to share-trading venues and not to derivatives trading.

“This is much more complicated because, legally speaking, we can only record as equivalent a jurisdiction that has a [derivatives]-trading obligation in place and at the moment there are only two jurisdictions that qualify: the US and Japan,” said Bassi. “For the others, we know they have plans to implement provisions for a trading obligation, but as long as there is not a clear plan to initiate a trading obligation within a reasonable time, legally speaking, an equivalence decision will not be possible.”

However, it may not be as important for the likes of Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia to get equivalence for derivatives trading, according to Vijay Chander, executive director of fixed income at Asifma.

“The reason the EU doesn’t care that much about giving equivalence to derivative venues in Asia is simply because 97% of such derivatives volumes goes to the US. So they were much more urgent in granting equivalence to the US. In Asia, the in-scope volumes are small,” he says.

Nonetheless, a representative of HKEX, who was speaking on the same panel as Bassi, expressed concern that Hong Kong might not receive immediate equivalence for derivatives.

“We have been working with the SFC [Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission] very closely, and we have filed all our documentation for share equivalence and derivatives equivalence,” said Angelina Kwan, head of regulatory compliance at HKEX. “We [want] to be an equivalent market for shares and derivatives, so that when EU financial institutions trade on our market they will not have any problem in terms of additional capital calculations going into their over-the-counter derivatives.”

Bassi acknowledged the importance of granting third-country equivalence for derivatives trading in Asia. Speaking to Risk.net on the sidelines of the FIA conference, he said: “I don’t have the figures, so I don’t know how significant this will be, but it is important because the businesses that are now trading derivatives won’t be able to do so in these markets [after January 3].”

He said it is difficult to say how much longer it might take to be able to grant equivalence decisions for derivatives trading in countries other than the US and Japan.

“This very much depends on our friends [in these countries],” he said. “We will help them as much as possible.”
