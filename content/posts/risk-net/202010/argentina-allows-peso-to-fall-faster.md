{{< quote steelblue >}}_Central bank increases repo rate as currency falls and inflation rises, despite severe GDP contraction_{{< /quote >}}

The Central Bank of Argentina raised policy rates and will allow a faster currency depreciation, amid continuing economic crisis, it announced on October 1.

The BCRA’s move comes despite stringent official restrictions on foreign currency, which have failed to bring unofficial exchange rates in line with the official value.

The central bank increased its policy repo rate from 19% to 24%. It said the hike aimed to discourage foreign currency purchases, and to offer more attractive returns to international investors. The central bank also announced new measures to encourage the use of the yuan in international transactions.

The BCRA is also making costly efforts to sustain the official exchange rate. On September 29, [foreign exchange reserves](http://www.bcra.gob.ar/PublicacionesEstadisticas/Principales_variables_datos_i.asp?serie=246&detalle=BCRAs%20stock%20of%20international%20reserves%20(in%20million%20USD)) declined by $370 million to $41.4 billion, their lowest level since January 2017. Argentina’s economy was hit by a severe recession before the onset of the pandemic, shrinking by 2.5% of GDP in 2018, and 2.2% in 2019. The Covid-19 outbreak has worsened Argentina’s problems, with the IMF forecasting GDP will fall by 5.7% in 2020.

In spite of capital and exchange rate controls, Argentina’s year-on-year inflation rate reached 40.7% in August.

On October 1, the central bank announced it would allow “greater volatility” in its controlled exchange rate regime.

“Within the framework of the managed float strategy, the daily depreciation rate will gradually adapt to the needs of the situation,” says the [policy statement](http://www.bcra.gob.ar/Noticias/Nuevas-medidas-politica-monetaria.asp). Over recent months the official exchange rate with the dollar has become increasingly untenable.

The official exchange rate stood at 76.26 pesos per US dollar on October 1, while the unofficial dólar blue rate was recorded at 147 pesos per dollar.

Argentine authorities are however continuing to monetise the government’s deficit, which many observers think is the root of Argentina’s lack of currency and price stability.

### Lack of trust in the peso

When Argentines became increasingly sceptical about the ability of the government of former president Mauricio Macri to control inflation, they started to buy dollars.

This created a feedback loop, putting downward pressure on the peso and boosting price increases, observers say. In order to stem the flow, Macri’s administration imposed capital controls in 2019. His successor, Alberto Fernández, has made them even stricter.

Citizens are only allowed to buy up to $200 in US dollars a month. They must also pay punitive taxes on their purchases of foreign currency: $130 in taxes if they buy the maximum level of dollars. Those receiving public support under the emergency programmes introduced in response to Covid-19 are prevented from buying dollars.

Capital controls sharply reduced dollar purchases from $3.9 billion in October 2019 to $99 million the following month, according to [central bank data](http://www.bcra.gob.ar/Pdfs/PublicacionesEstadisticas/Informe_agosto_2020.pdf). However, in spite of the restrictions, the worsening economic situation kept boosting dollar demand, which rose to $750 million in August 2020.

This reflects a sharp increase in people buying dollars, from 500,000 in January to 3.9 million in August.

### IMF negotiations

Argentina’s monetary and exchange rate policies will remain the focus of the authorities’ negotiations with the International Monetary Fund. In August, Fernández’s government requested yet another support programme from the IMF, despite already being a major recipient.

In 2018, Macri’s administration secured the fund’s largest-ever programme, a $57 billion standby arrangement package. Around $44 billion of that package has already been lent. The current administration says it is only looking for support to refinance these outstanding liabilities, and does not seek additional funding.

IMF staff are scheduled to visit the country in the coming week to discuss Buenos Aires’ last request.

### Renminbi to finance trade

The central bank also announced it will allow the purchase of renminbi against the peso to finance international trade operations. It will also permit firms and individuals to enter into futures contracts denominated in the Chinese currency.

“This measure does not imply that physical yuan can be purchased for hoarding, nor will the opening of bank accounts denominated in that currency be allowed,” says the central bank. “It is intended to facilitate foreign trade operations.”

The central banks will use its renminbi-denominated foreign exchange reserves to covers these operations. It says it does not plan to activate its currency swap agreement with the People's Bank of China.

The agreement was originally signed in 2009, and renewed for three years in August 2020. Its maximum value now stands at 130 billion yuan ($19.1 billion).
