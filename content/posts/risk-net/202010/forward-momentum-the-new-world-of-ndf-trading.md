{{< quote steelblue >}}_NDF landscape is changing as trading volumes drive electronification and algo execution – but challenges remain_{{< /quote >}}

When the foreign exchange desk at BNP Paribas received a $100 million order for a US dollar/Korean won non-deliverable forward (NDF) trade recently, it turned to what would have once been inconceivable for that over-the-counter market: an algorithm that completed 80% of the trade by looking at the bank’s offsetting flows.

It shows the progress that has been made in the NDF market in recent years. Average daily volumes nearly doubled between 2016 and 2019, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), while electronic execution has been on the rise, allowing an increasing number of banks to offer algos to their clients.

Asif Razaq, global head of foreign exchange algorithmic execution at BNP Paribas, says that as market-makers have started applying algorithmic pricing and risk management technology developed for their G10 businesses to NDFs, the market is becoming “electronically mature”, reaching a point where algo execution can take off in the main Asia NDF pairs: Korean won, Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah, New Taiwan dollar and Philippine peso.

BNP Paribas is among a number of banks that offer NDF algos to clients; others include Barclays, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and JP Morgan, with more understood to be on the way. Plans are also being drawn up by a number of banks to extend algo execution to Latin American pairs, particularly the Brazilian real.

The post-trade infrastructure is also expected to change in the coming years as non-cleared margin rules hit buy-side firms and make clearing NDFs more attractive to some than keeping them bilateral.

But while the market is changing rapidly, there are some headwinds buffeting its development. First, despite the rise in trading volumes, the relative lack of liquidity means there is a perception among some clients that algos are unsuitable.

“Most clients are still of the opinion that NDFs are very illiquid markets and algos won’t quite work in those markets,” says Razaq. Fifteen per cent of potential clients currently use the bank’s NDF algos.

Banks also find it more challenging to risk manage algo flows in these less-liquid markets compared to the spot market, while the risk of information leakage is still there despite the increase in the number of new venues offering NDFs.

And while some market-makers and prime brokers are said to be starting to offer differentiated pricing for cleared and non-cleared NDFs, not everyone is convinced there will be a big rush from the buy side to use clearing houses voluntarily.

### Going electronic

NDFs offer a way to hedge and speculate in currencies that are not freely traded, though NDF trading also occurs in G10 pairs. The cash payout is based on the difference between the agreed forward rate and the spot rate at maturity, typically one or three months after the trade takes effect.

NDF trading has been on the rise in recent years, with the average daily volume in 2019 nearly double what it was three years previously, according to the latest triennial FX survey released by the BIS. The 2019 survey, which offers one of the most comprehensive reviews of the FX market, reported $258 billion in average daily NDF volume against the US dollar, up from $130 billion in 2016 (see figure 1).

With $60 billion of average daily volume, the South Korean won remained the most actively traded currency against the US dollar. But trading in the Indian rupee grew the most between the two most recent BIS surveys, tripling to $50 billion from $16 billion in average daily volume against the US dollar.

Patrick Wu, head of linear FX and emerging markets trading for Asia at Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, says the growth in NDF volumes has already triggered a self-reinforcing effect.

As investors in the West turn to emerging markets in the hunt for returns, NDFs are an ideal tool for them to use to hedge their exposures. Local market participants’ hedging needs have also helped increase demand. Taiwanese life insurers, for instance, who in recent years have piled into US dollar-denominated bonds known as [Formosas](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5287696/formosas-the-fed-and-the-billion-dollar-bermudan-trade), need to manage the FX mismatch on their balance sheet as their liabilities remain in the local New Taiwan dollar, says Wu.

This growing hedging demand has fed into a liquidity-generating cycle where platforms have expanded to offer NDF trading, banks now stream prices to clients through APIs, and the buy side has built programmatic strategies that rely on the market’s electronification.

“Suddenly, these [systematic] strategies became significantly more profitable for that segment of the hedge fund community,” says Mark Meredith, head of FX electronic trading and algorithmic execution at Citi, who calls this interaction between dealers and their systematic clients a “virtuous cycle” of liquidity.

“Banks can offload some of their risk to systematic funds, and effectively they act as hedging venues for banks that are getting larger tickets from real money clients on the other side,” says Meredith.

As a result, dealers all claim that electronification has also been on the rise. For example, Myriam Sifaoui, global emerging business manager at Societe Generale, says the majority of the bank’s interactions with clients are now electronic, with hedge funds making up most of the electronic flow.

Hard numbers to corroborate the trend are difficult to come by, however. Data from the Bank of England’s Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee semi-annual survey showed that just over a third of average daily NDF volumes traded on electronic platforms or broker systems in April this year, which is a fall from the survey’s high of 44% in October 2017 (see figure 2).

The survey captures roughly half of volumes reported by the BIS and represents trades “priced out of London”. Surveys conducted by other national authorities list only outright forwards or do not specify the method of execution for NDF trading.

Dealers point out that a lot of the NDF volumes take place in Asia timezones, meaning they might not be picked up by this survey.

Rob Hutchins, head of fixed income, currencies and commodity execution services for Asia at Goldman Sachs, says the bank’s global execution figures currently resemble the BoE survey’s findings, with roughly a third of volumes executed electronically. “Although, there has definitely been an increase in the adoption of electronic [execution] broadly across all client types,” he adds.

The percentage of one-month volumes being done electronically is growing, says Hutchins, but the volumes on central limit order books are no longer rising as banks internalise more of their flow.

Crédit Agricole CIB’s Wu says that while a vast majority of NDF trades have already moved to electronic platforms, a “large part of the NDF volume growth is driven by non-deliverable swaps”. These products are effectively a group of NDFs bundled together – on each fixing date, parties exchange US dollar payments depending on where the exchange rate is compared to the spot rate at the outset of the trade.

Electronic platforms, particularly the interbank e-trading venues, have yet to capture more of those versus voice dealing, says Wu, meaning there is plenty of room for electronic volumes to grow.

### Algo execution

As electronic NDF volumes grow, so has interest in using algos to execute trades – though a key problem with NDF algos has always been the fees charged for execution on venues, which are higher than for spot trades due to the increased liquidity risk.

Bigger volumes mean more platforms are offering the product, however, with increasingly advanced features. At the end of August, Euronext [launched an NDF platform](https://www.fx-markets.com/infrastructure/7685986/euronext-launches-ndf-trading-in-singapore) in Singapore that provides all the features of its spot platform, such as customised liquidity pools.

And as competition among venues offering NDFs grows, this has helped lower fees. BNP Paribas, at least, has in turn passed those savings to clients executing through algos, says Razaq.

Even taking venue fees into account, he says, the bank’s analysis of NDF algo trading has found that algos help reduce transaction costs regardless of order size. The difference was especially apparent for large tickets, he says, and trades see an average saving of 8 basis points.

Goldman’s Hutchins agrees, saying that while the price of giving a whole order direct to a trading desk, known as risk transfer, is tight at small sizes, it’s a different story when you reach the bigger trades.

“Algos remain an additional tool in the toolkit, not a panacea. It depends on the client’s sophistication, appetite to take risk and typical trade sizes. The risk transfer pricing that clients see in small amounts is extremely competitive. Therefore a lot of people view it as only making sense to use an algo and take that market risk for slightly bigger tickets,” says Hutchins.

More platforms also means more fragmented liquidity, which gives clients another reason to use algos, this time to pull that liquidity together. But Alex Shterenberg, global head of G10 and emerging market electronic FX trading at Barclays, says that while algos require liquidity fragmentation to prove their efficiency, they do need adequate liquidity.

“Some NDF currencies are not ready for algos or electronic trading in general,” he says.

Although other venues now offer NDF execution, the risk remains that liquidity is too thin and that information leakage occurs, allowing market participants to see trading patterns and move the market against the client before they’ve completed their order.

“When considering a venue for inclusion into the NDF algo offering or the market-making book, there needs to be a critical mass of volume for it to make sense, given the risk of potential signalling,” says Hutchins.

The relative lack of liquidity also makes risk management of algo flows difficult, hindering development. For instance, the range of algo trading styles available in NDFs is eclipsed by those in the spot space.

“These products remain at heart quite illiquid. Even in our electronic business, we are holding positions for a day at a time in some cases, which for an electronic business is a long time. Clients need to bear that in mind and parameterise their algorithms appropriately,” says Citi’s Meredith.

Lack of liquidity, along with infrastructure challenges, could also hinder the roll-out of algos to Latin America NDFs (see box: Latin America: opportunities and challenges).

Goldman’s Hutchins says that in general with NDFs, a bank’s ability to offset those flows internally becomes hugely impactful on the performance of its NDF algos.

Internalisation rates for NDFs vary between banks, with Goldman and one other dealer saying they can achieve up to 40% in their algos.

### All clear?

While algos are the big focus now, another big change coming up for the NDF market is the potential for a move to clearing for the buy side.

Unlike physical FX forwards, NDFs have been subject to variation margin since March 2017 under the global non-cleared margin rules, with the initial margin requirement phased in over time. The regulation’s final two phases are planned for September 2021 and September 2022, the first bringing into scope firms with over-the-counter derivatives volumes exceeding €50 billion in average aggregate notional amount and the second bringing in firms with between €8 billion and €50 billion.

With the addition of [Goldman Sachs](https://www.fx-markets.com/infrastructure/7668351/goldman-signs-up-as-ndf-client-clearer-at-lch) in August, seven dealers are signed up to clear client NDF trades at LCH, citing expectations of increasing volumes. But clearing interest has stalled due to Covid [disruption](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7513521/industry-calls-for-suspension-of-im-compliance-dates)s. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organization of Securities Commissions recommended in April that the final two phases each be delayed a year as a result of the operational [disruption](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7513521/industry-calls-for-suspension-of-im-compliance-dates) caused by the pandemic.

“Interest has been lagging for some months after the postponment of the non-cleared margin phase that was about to kick off. There are some clients starting to clear, but most of the others are waiting for the regulation to kick in to start clearing,” says Societe Generale’s Sifaoui.

Sifaoui says the bank has mainly focused on new trades in its conversations with clients and has not extensively discussed backloading older trades.

Paddy Boyle, global head of ForexClear at LCH, thinks the pandemic may ultimately incentivise clearing. The volatility in March and the ongoing challenges presented by Covid-19 have focused traders’ attention on counterparty risk and the benefits of clearing, he says.

“You’ve seen some markets that haven’t published fixes on some days, which has reminded people of the difficulties the market experienced on Ukraine and Argentina,” says Boyle.

Last year, the bilateral market was hit by turmoil when the imposition of currency controls in Argentina led to a divergence between the rate being used in the market and the rate used to settle the contracts. This led to a 30-day shutdown of trading, [sowing chaos and confusion](https://www.fx-markets.com/regulation/7511961/seeing-red-over-blue-chip-swap-in-argentinas-ndf-fiasco) in the market.

The Emerging Markets Trade Association, which oversees bilateral NDF contracts, rushed out a protocol to confirm the rate to be used. Not everyone signed up, however, and banks had to negotiate with some clients bilaterally to avoid different rates being applied to different legs, which would reduce their netting benefits.

If the trades were cleared, any change in methodology in response to such an unexpected scenario would automatically be applied to all trades, meaning dealers could have more confidence that their longs and shorts would be treated in the same way.

Clearing at LCH has remained relatively steady since 2018. In July, $1.4 trillion in NDF notional passed through the clearing house, compared to $1.5 trillion in January 2018. The initial surge in clearing came in late 2016 as dealers were brought into scope of the initial margin rules. The figures include both legs of cleared trades (see figure 3).

The pace of future clearing growth may be slow, though. Ashvin Parkash, global head of e-FX distribution at Nomura, says the bank has not seen huge interest in NDF clearing from clients.

“Whilst we expect interest to grow, we don’t see this reaching a significant level in the near term,” says Parkash.

The non-cleared margin rules are intended to incentivise clearing by making initial margin for bilateral trades more expensive than cleared. While at least one bank says the difference is negligible, Boyle says they’re starting to see it reflected in dealer pricing for NDFs.

“We’re beginning to see banks quoting clients better pricing if they clear. Once you have platforms where the quoted prices are specific for clearing or not for clearing, best execution will come into play, and the reasons for clearing will become more compelling,” he says.

### Latin America: opportunities and challenges
While NDF algo trading in Asian currencies has driven the growth so far, a number of banks say they are hoping to expand into Latin American currencies.

“Every client I speak to about NDF trading is asking me, “When can I get Brazilian real up and running?” says Asif Razaq, global head of FX algorithmic execution at BNP Paribas.

Brazilian real NDFs against the US dollar make up the third most-traded pair, according to the most recent BIS survey, and had the fourth most cleared volumes at LCH in July.

Since a lot of Brazilian real trades locally, it can be harder to use an algo to execute, says Razaq. This is because an algo has to source liquidity from the onshore futures market and then convert the trade into an NDF, as opposed to finding direct NDF liquidity in the over-the-counter market.

“No single interdealer broker has built any kind of viable interbank product in Latin American NDFs today. The interbank markets are already extremely fragmented with a local exchange in each country,” says Mark Meredith, head of FX electronic trading and algorithmic execution at Citi.

Others say the broader obstacle to expanding NDF trading in the region is the smaller daily volumes relative to more liquid NDF pairs, a high percentage of which remains voice brokered. In this sense the development and electronification lags behind Asia markets.
