{{< quote steelblue >}}_Portfolio reductions reaped $10.8 billion of RWA savings_{{< /quote >}}

HSBC’s efforts to lower its risk-weighted assets were undercut by foreign currency effects in the third quarter. These added $14.2 billion to RWAs over the three months to end-September, almost entirely offsetting $15.1 billion of reductions achieved by shrinking its portfolio and refining its credit risk models.

As of end-September, the bank’s RWAs stood at $857 billion, virtually flat on three months prior. Excluding currency effects, though, they would have shrunk 1.4%.   A reduction in the size of its overall portfolio pushed RWAs down $10.8 billion. The asset cull was primarily focused on the global banking and markets and commercial banking divisions. Some $5.3 billion of these savings also came from a drop in market RWAs. These shrank as the bank offloaded sovereign exposures and its models responded to calmer market conditions, as well as through undisclosed “management initiatives”.

Changes to risk-weighting methodologies and policies achieved a further $4.3 billion of savings, largely due to the fine-tuning of “risk parameters” for exposures in Asia and Europe.

On the flipside, a decline in asset quality added a net $3 billion to RWAs. The gross effect of credit rating downgrades at the commercial bank totalled $4.8 billion, which were offset somewhat by changes to the portfolio.

HSBC’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio stood at 15.6% at September 30, up 60 basis points on three months prior. Stripping out currency effects, which inflated both numerator and denominator, the ratio would have been 15.5%. The bank is targeting a ratio of 14% to 14.5%.
