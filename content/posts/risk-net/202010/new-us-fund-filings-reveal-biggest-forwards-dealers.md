Analysis of foreign exchange forwards trading in almost 3,000 US mutual fund filings has revealed a handful of banks dominate the business, with the top four dealers alone taking half of market share in the second quarter, and the top seven accounting for more than two-thirds of all volume.

The study is based on individual fund filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during the first and second quarters this year, comprising 185,091 trades with a total value of $1.75 trillion. It shows FX forwards executed with Citi, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas – in that rank order – totalled $374 billion in the second quarter, a 48.38% market share.

The analysis also shows concentration increased from the first quarter, when the same top four executed $459 billion of forwards, for a 47.16% market share.

Introduced at the end of last year, the filings are made on a monthly basis to the SEC and disclosed to the public on a quarterly basis. It is not a perfect dataset – in aggregating the information, FX Markets identified and corrected a number of errors in individual fund filings. Spot checks were also carried out with certain dealers to test the data, but it should still be treated with some caution (see box: About this data).

Despite its drawbacks, the dataset provides new information about the structure of an important segment of the FX markets – offering a glimpse of fund and dealer behaviour.

### Strengths and weaknesses

Apart from dealer concentration, there are many other takeaways. One is the sheer strength of Citi in the forwards market – overall, the bank had a 17.42% market share by value in the first quarter, far ahead of JP Morgan on 11.45%. Citi’s market share fell slightly to 15.75% in the second quarter, but was still nearly 3% ahead of its rival.

Across 17 cuts of data – by region, currency pair, trade size and tenor – Citi topped 11 tables in the first quarter, and nine in the second. In almost all cases where the bank was not top by value, it would have been top if measured by number of trades.

In Americas pairs (excluding G10 pairs) for example, the US bank had a 24.62% market share by volume in Q1, nearly twice as much as its closest rival. In the second quarter, it extended this share to 26.72%.

There are only two areas where the bank does not appear in the top three by volume. One is in Asia-Pacific currencies (excluding G10 pairs), where Citi is fourth in both quarters – but measured by tickets it would top the tables. Another is in trades with tenors longer than one year, where it sits fourth.

The second quarter, though, did see a fightback by its rivals, with both JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley gaining ground overall. JP Morgan made a big move in non-G10 currencies, gaining 3% market share and moving into second place on the back of improvements in Asia and the Americas.

Morgan Stanley gained ground mainly in G10 currencies, moving into second place on the back of big gains in euro/US dollar, where it gained nearly 5.5% market share.

Looking more closely at the data, the strengths of other dealers are revealed. In Americas currencies, for example, Santander ranked very highly – it took second spot in the first quarter, with a 13.07% share. This share increased in the second quarter, but the Spanish bank was leapfrogged by JP Morgan, dropping back to third place. Much of Santander’s volume comes from US dollar/Brazilian real trades with various Pimco funds.

State Street has a noticeable G10 focus, coming fourth in that table in both quarters. In EUR/USD specifically it came third in the first quarter, before dropping back to fourth with an 8.57% share. For non-G10 currencies, it placed eleventh and twelfth in the first and second quarters, respectively.

Bank of America has a clear strength in Europe, Middle East and Africa currencies (excluding G10 pairs), topping the table in both quarters.

BNP Paribas has a strong market presence in Asia-Pacific by volume but with fewer trades than its rivals. The bulk of the large trades that propelled it to top spot in the first quarter were with Vanguard, including three Korean won deals that were each in excess of $3.7 billion.

By trade tenor, Goldman Sachs shows a clear aptitude for trades longer than a year, scoring its only top position across the tables in the first quarter before dropping one spot in the second quarter. During the first quarter, for instance, the US bank struck an Australian dollar/yen trade with PGIM that matures in October 2023.

In both quarters, HSBC sits third for these longer-dated forwards, with far fewer, but larger, trades than its rivals. These consist mainly of US dollar/Chinese renminbi forwards, particularly with Dodge & Cox.

In the major pairs, the main mover between quarters was UBS, which went from second position in EUR/USD in the first quarter – its highest ranking in any table – to seventh in the second, with its market share nearly halving in the process.

Toronto-Dominion Bank was a huge mover in the other direction in USD/JPY, leaping from twenty-fourth to fifth place. The jump was driven by significantly increased activity with large funds such as Pimco and Vanguard. USD/JPY is also the only pair where Barclays cracks the top five.

Toronto-Dominion also placed highly for trades above $500 million, placing fifth in the first quarter and sixth in the following quarter.

HSBC is unsurprisingly the leader in USD/CNY, boasting a 27.89% market share in the first quarter – more than 10% higher than its rivals. The bank’s lead was pegged back in the second quarter, taking a 22.93% market share, ahead of JP Morgan on 20.6%.

### About this data
The information used in this analysis comes from NPORT-P filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

This is a relatively new form, introduced at the end of last year, which requires funds to file monthly summaries of their portfolio holdings to the SEC. The filings include FX forward transactions among many other instruments, and reveal details including bank counterparty names, currencies, trade sizes and tenor.

The forms are filed to the SEC on a monthly basis, and the regulator makes the final filing of a given fund’s quarter public 60 days after the end of that period. The filings are in a structured XML form, making it possible to download and parse the data for trends.

Roughly 32,000 filings in the year to September 17 were analysed for this exercise. These filings were placed into quarterly buckets based on the reporting period they refer to. Of these filings, 1,371 made in the first quarter, yielding 101,786 trades across 33 banks at a total value of $974 billion. In the second quarter, 1,411 filings gave up 83,305 trades across 36 banks for a total value of $774 billion.

It’s important to caveat the information. While these are pro-forma regulatory filings to the SEC and should be accurate, mistakes and miscategorisations do occur. The data was cleaned and obvious errors excluded, while a handful of results were checked with the relevant banks. It was not possible to check every trade and FX Markets takes no responsibility for filing errors.

We intend to track these stats every quarter, so please get in touch if something doesn’t look right and needs closer investigation, or to suggest other ways to present or analyse the data – next time round, we may look at trading by individual funds, for example.
