{{< quote steelblue >}}_Polls point to a decisive Biden win – though some worry market is being complacent_{{< /quote >}}

Options volatilities for major US dollar currency pairs have declined steadily since September amid receding fears of a contested presidential election – though some see the low readings as a sign of complacency ahead of a major risk event.

The shift in sentiment was reflected in two-month options on the safe-haven yen. These were trading at more than nine volatility points on September 21, up from 7.192 at the start of the month, but have since retraced most of that ground.

“After the [first presidential] debate [on September 29], I think the market caught on to the fact that if you look at the numbers, [Donald] Trump’s chances aren’t looking so great. And as such, the risk premium that the market was demanding for the US election has come off continuously,” says Julian Weiss, head of FX options for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Nomura.

With Joe Biden maintaining a near double-digit polling lead going into the final debate on October 23, market participants were increasingly reluctant to pay a high premium to hedge against wild currency swings after election day.

“There was a lot of risk premium, a lot of extra volatility priced in around those dates, starting early November, all the way out to late November and even December. And that pricing has been taken out of the vol market,” Weiss says.

Others worry the pendulum has swung too far the other way. “The thing about the options market is that people do understand the tail risk. They’ve seen it [before],” says one FX options specialist. “We’ve all seen it, and more than once. I think maybe people are too sanguine because the options markets do have that tail risk just there.”

FX options volatilities spiked after Donald Trump’s surprise election triumph in 2016, which pushed the US dollar to an 11-month high. The FX options specialist says the market may be underestimating the potential for large currency moves after the upcoming election. “Personally, I find it very hard to predict what will happen in the FX market,” he says.

According to Nomura, overnight US dollar volatilities for November 4 implied by the current volatility curve are higher than they were for the day after the 2016 election – with the exception of USD/JPY (see figure 1). Over the past week, the bank has seen volatilities “squeezing higher again due to increased nervousness around the postal vote and stress limits hedging needs”.

“We expect this pattern to continue into next week, so we could enter election night with overnight volatility at levels last seen one month ago,” Nomura says.

### Mixed messages

The big bet in the market currently is on a lower greenback. Hedge funds and real money investors have been expressing this view through downside digital options on the USD/CNH currency pair, with maturities of up to two years, according to dealers. A digital option provides a fixed payout if the underlying asset crosses a pre-determined strike price.

The thesis is that a Biden victory would pave the way for a large stimulus package and an easing of trade tensions with China. Investors are also betting that China’s economy will recover much faster from the Covid-19 pandemic that the US.

Not everyone is buying into that narrative. “I think there is an awful lot of bearishness about the US dollar at the moment,” says Michael Hewson, chief market analysts at CMC Markets. “Personally, I don’t think it’s justified, and certainly I’m not seeing people taking out insurance.”

The dollar has already lost a lot of ground against the renminbi and Hewson thinks the Chinese government could intervene to weaken its currency. He also notes that the dollar rallied in 2016 despite Trump’s promise of massive fiscal stimulus.

The bond market also seems to be sending the opposite message. Yield curves have steepened in recent weeks, pointing to higher inflation and an improving economic outlook for the US in the long term.

“I wouldn’t be taking a dollar-negative position. I would be looking to buy the dollar on the dip,” adds Hewson. “I’ve learned never to bet against the bond markets because they can tell me where the smart money is going.”

The market is pricing in some of this uncertainty. USD/CNH options have bucked the trend of falling volatilities. One-month options were at nearly seven volatility points on October 26, up from 5.265 at the start of September.
