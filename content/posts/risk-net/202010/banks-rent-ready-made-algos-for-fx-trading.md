{{< quote steelblue >}}_NatWest, XTX Markets and others develop new outsourcing model for tech_{{< /quote >}}

In past years, banks would develop and market their own trading algorithms in an attempt to win more foreign exchange business from clients.

They’ve since discovered an easier method. Many now use somebody else’s trading algorithms, repackage them and label them as their own.

White-labelling, as it’s known, has become an increasingly common way for FX dealers to gain algo trading volumes quickly and cheaply. But a new variant of this technique is appearing. A handful of dealers are beginning to display other liquidity providers’ algorithms next to their own in-house products on their platforms. Users can see which algo is offered by which provider. Less white-label, more right-label.

NatWest is among those that have started to participate in this model. The bank outsources algorithms as well as “insourcing” them from the likes of electronic market-maker XTX Markets. In effect, the algo provider brings its liquidity while the bank takes the credit risk.

“Some algo firms like XTX or other banks would love to access certain clients they don’t have. To do so, they will let other banks’ clients access their algos for a small price,” says Fabio Madar, co-head of currencies at NatWest Markets.

In working this way, banks hope to increase their stickiness to clients and improve their chances of earning a spread on any other transactions at the end of the algo trade or in other fixed income products.

For the buy side, firms that once shunned algos now deem them an important part of the execution process. So, they are using more of them – 41% more year-over-year, according to data from Refinitiv’s FXall, a buy-side trading venue.

As currency dealers jostle for a share of this growing pie, many are rethinking the way they provide algorithms as part of the FX product suite. The winning solution might ultimately come down to the size of their own franchise.

Regional and local banks in Asia and parts of Europe appear to favour the use of algorithms they can white-label from their larger peers. This type of arrangement ensures that these smaller banks not only shave months off their ability to start delivering the machine-enabled trading strategies to clients. It also eliminates the millions of dollars these institutions would have to spend to develop and maintain their own algorithm suite.

“The white-labelling offer is coming more from banks who did not develop their own algos and want to show this offer to their client base such as corporates, asset managers or hedge funds,” says Alex Dewhurst, head of FX and emerging markets sales for financial institutions at Societe Generale.

Global banks with their big distribution networks are trying a different route. Like NatWest, they are adding electronic market-makers to their platforms, to widen their range of [algorithmic strategies](https://www.fx-markets.com/trading/7510491/in-choppy-fx-markets-algos-buck-expectations). Under these partnerships, the brand’s name remains on the label.

“We face the clients directly, we are the legal counterparty, we are responsible for the onboarding, the trade lines, all this is done by the bank,” says Madar at NatWest. “But in the background, there is another algo firm who provides their own algo.”

In September, XTX Markets began distributing its implementation shortfall algorithm, a proprietary strategy that seeks to reduce overall slippage to arrival price, to banks and allowing them to offer the strategy to their real money and corporate clients.

“The banks that we partner with are taking the first step into a completely different sort of world,” says Jeremy Smart, global head of distribution at XTX Markets. “They are saying to people, ‘I am going to offer you somebody else’s product. I am going to generate more value for you.’’’ He declines to discuss the fee structure for this model.

Introducing a competing product into its distribution network can bring corollary value for a bank. At the minimum it gives a bank the freedom to redeploy its already scarce resources and capital to its main areas of expertise rather than stretching itself thin competing with other providers that have a clear advantage.

When it comes to the bottom line, giving customers access to more algorithms on its platform can help a bank to increase its profit margins. This is because by offering another provider’s algorithm, a bank can share in the revenue gained from its use.

The set-up also enables the bank to enlarge the amount of business it does with a client, and strengthen relationships.

Hosting someone else’s algorithms could be a boon for banks that have good credit and client coverage, but relatively less competitive FX products when compared to a large provider. Banks that fall into this category get paid for using their credit lines, operational workflow, and for the account onboarding for customers.

### Rebadging

Traditional white-labelling solutions are also gaining traction. A number of dealers are ditching the idea of building out an algorithm suite, opting instead to rebrand another firm’s product and sell it as their own so as to bring products to market quicker.

“It costs money to develop and maintain an algo suite: to have your quants, to have your systems, to verify them. The business case can be challenging when you’re a small bank,” says an executive at a local European bank. “We take the view that we are better off having somebody else develop and maintain the algo suite for us.”

The bank has been using the traditional white-labelling model to build out its FX services since 2019, and has installed six different algorithmic strategies from a large FX dealer bank. By white-labelling the strategies, the bank was able to take a shortcut to meeting client demands for a mixture of passive and aggressive trading strategies without much of the development work.

“As a local bank you need to ask yourself whether you have the resources and capabilities to ever reach the level of sophistication of the tier one banks in a commercially sustainable way,” says the executive.

But white-labelling does not come without risk. Loss of control and transparency into the algorithms are a concern for dealers. Firms that have developed algos internally know the exact ingredients in the secret sauce. Importing the technology from a third party could leave the dealer exposed if the algo breaks down. There is also the risk that the client could drop the offering if they already deal directly with the partner bank supplying the algo, sources say.

Still, the executive from the local bank believes clients benefit from a better quality of execution, especially when trading large orders, because bigger dealers have a much larger liquidity pool than local players do. Large dealers can limit the market impact from big orders by [internalising](https://www.fx-markets.com/tech-and-data/7671266/barclays-targets-internalisation-with-new-ndf-algos) a chunk of the trades.

Transactions made by clients using these algorithms bypass the local dealer bank and go directly to the partner bank, which bears the risk. The partner bank informs the dealer whenever a client trades so that the activity, including the transaction cost analysis report, can be booked before sending the information to the client.

Overall, the cost structure for white-labelling algorithms is very much dependent on the currencies: there is usually a difference between G10 and emerging markets. The pricing also reflects the liquidity of the currency, and the embedded cost for a bank to implement these strategies. Similarly, the technology behind the algorithms, their level of sophistication and their effect on trade performance, can also affect the price paid to use them.

It is understood that partner banks can charge their smaller peers a fixed fee of $20 per million for renting algorithms – a huge saving when considering the investment necessary for these banks to develop their own proprietary solutions. On top of that, a local bank can in turn charge clients a fee of $0 to $100 per million for the use of algos.

### Asia activity

The impact on the bottom line is also partly contributing to the rise in interest for algorithms from Asian banks. Asia-Pacific is one of the fastest growing regions in FX trading, with a 22% increase in the average daily volume since 2016, according to the latest Bank for International Settlements figures. The use of algorithms is evolving with it across both spot FX and derivatives.

A head of electronic currencies distribution at a global tier one bank says regional players in Asia have approached the bank asking to white-label its algos to pass them on to customers.

“They realise that it’s hard to try to catch up with [big banks] and spend more and more money on it. It makes more sense just to white-label big banks’ algos,” he says.

He’s not the only one keeping an eye on activities in Asia. SocGen’s Dewhurst says interest from local markets is building even though the volume traded on algos is smaller than that of Europe and the US. However, clients will need to gain sophistication with algos before they can be used for instruments such as non-deliverable forwards.

“The bulk of these are on Asian currencies, so there is a growing interest. But at the same time, NDFs remain rather illiquid relatively speaking,” Dewhurst says. “The standard for now in terms of executing NDFs is mainly in risk transfer.”

Jason Radzik, head of Americas derivatives execution and clearing at BNP Paribas, says it is not just regional banks that are getting in on the trend. He expects it to start to trickle up to larger dealers.

Radzik says banks, especially smaller ones, are under pressure to cut costs, and are starting to realise that unless they have a big franchise with a large client base to use the technology built in-house, acting like a fintech provider is a money-losing effort.

“One way you can cut costs is by looking at what commoditised or non-differentiating technology you can essentially stop maintaining on your own but still get the same or better quality product by outsourcing a third-party’s financial technology,” he says.

Algorithms can also help the buy side and sell side better illustrate their compliance with the best execution and other requirements of the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Advocates say they provide a more controlled, reliable and auditable trading experience that helps to reduce market impact and execution costs.

Dealers say the cost-income ratio of most FX businesses has dramatically changed in the past 10 years. Added to that, the cost of technology along with the hefty price tag for ensuring continued regulatory compliance is running head on into declining revenues.

“All major FX banks have undergone deep tech transformations which were very costly. At the same time, new regulatory requirements have substantially augmented, further pushing the costs higher. On the revenues side, margin compression had been going on for a few decades,” says Madar at NatWest. “Therefore, renting infrastructure rather than building has become a good solution. That’s why outsourcing has been a theme in the industry although it’s been slow to implement.”

Some 37% of FX market participants in the US and Europe use algorithms to trade only 22% of their overall volumes, according to consultancy Greenwich Associates. By comparison, algorithmic trading has become nearly ubiquitous among institutional traders in equity markets, where 46% of trade volume is now executed through either direct market access, smart order routing or algorithmic trades.

There are several reasons for the relatively [low level](https://www.fx-markets.com/technology/algorithmic-trading/4510956/algo-adoption-at-inflection-point-driven-by-buy-side) of uptake in FX. The lack of trade disclosure requirements in FX means market participants do not have access to the universal data on pricing and execution that inform algorithms in equities. Also, many FX trades originate as second-order hedges, as opposed to alpha generators, and this limits the utility of algo trades to some market participants.

Some believe the low usage means there is healthy room for growth in FX algos. Others feel the technology needs to [evolve further](https://www.fx-markets.com/tech-and-data/7670581/fx-algos-and-the-weight-of-industry-expectations) before algo penetration can take the next step forward.

Either way, the feeling is that algo trading is, for now, a fixture in foreign exchange markets.

“It has become clear that algos are here to stay and are growing,” says XTX’s Smart. “Perhaps a year ago the jury was slightly out on that. The jury is no longer out on that.”
