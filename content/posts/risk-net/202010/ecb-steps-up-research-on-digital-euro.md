The European Central Bank is significantly increasing its work on a possible “digital euro”, issuing a report on the subject on October 2.

“We should be prepared to issue a digital euro, should the need arise,” says ECB president Christine Lagarde. The ECB also announced it will open a [public consultation](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr201002~f90bfc94a8.en.html) on a central bank-issued digital currency, or CBDC, on October 12.

[The ECB report](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/Report_on_a_digital_euro~4d7268b458.en.pdf?0b17405a54c7c6ad4e137e257dd02672) analyses the characteristics a eurozone central bank-issued digital currency could have, as well as the scenarios that could make it necessary. Experts at both the ECB and the eurozone’s 19 national central banks have contributed to the study.

The governing council has not taken a decision yet on whether to introduce a digital euro, and the ECB says it will continue issuing cash in any scenario.

“Europeans are increasingly turning to digital in the ways they spend, save and invest. Our role is to secure trust in money,” says Lagarde. “This means making sure the euro is fit for the digital age.”

The report identifies scenarios under which a CBDC would be necessary. These include increased demand for electronic payments, demanding a European digital means of payment. A significant decline in the use of cash as a means of payment might also make it necessary to adopt a CBDC, the report says.

Adopting a digital euro “could also be crucial if people were to turn to foreign digital means of payment, which might undermine financial stability and monetary sovereignty in the euro area”, the ECB says.

The report says that the ECB may have to issue a digital currency if eurozone consumers adopted a global private means of payment, such as Facebook’s libra.

“The report concludes that we should be ready to issue a digital euro if and when developments around us make it necessary,” says ECB executive board member Fabio Panetta in a [blogpost](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2020/html/ecb.blog201002~12ab1c06b5.en.html). “This means that we already need to be preparing for it. In the coming months, we will listen and experiment so that we are in a position to take a fully informed decision on the possible development and launch of a digital euro.”

Panetta says a digital euro would foster innovation in the eurozone and contribute to protect financial sovereignty, while strengthening the international role of the euro.

“A digital euro would also protect us from the potential for a public or private digital means of payment, issued and controlled from outside the euro area,” says Panetta. “It would promote innovation in retail payments, synergising with the new payment solutions that citizens and businesses need to prosper in innovative digital markets.”

A CBDC in the eurozone would make the euro more attractive to people living in other regions, Panetta says. It would also allow authorities “to more effectively combat illegal activities, such as money laundering and the financing of terrorism”.

Nonetheless, Panetta acknowledges that issuing a digital euro entails serious challenges. Some of them are related to privacy. The platform handling the currency would record all transactions, exposing citizens’ transactions to scrutiny in a way cash does not.

Other commentators have voiced fears that a digital euro could hamper commercial banks’ business model. If a CBDC was issued, banks could lose their current monopoly in directly accessing central bank money.

In the current low-interest rate environment, citizens could then lose another incentive to engage with commercial banks. A digital euro could also allow sharp withdrawals during time of economic stress, possibly exacerbating financial crises.

### Centralised or decentralised?

The ECB’s report studies two main models with the underlying infrastructure underpinning a future digital euro.

One would be a centralised platform recording all transactions in a central bank’s ledger. The other would feature some decentralisation of tasks to supervised financial intermediaries.

The main difference between both is the role of the private sector. “While in a direct model supervised intermediaries are mere gatekeepers, in an intermediated model they would play a more prominent role, including that of settlement agents,” says the report.

In a centralised platform, payments can be instructed by end users in the central bank infrastructure. An alternative within this centralised model would be that transactions are initiated by users, but managed by supervised intermediaries handling accounts with the central bank on users’ behalf.

But in a fully decentralised platform, consumers would have direct access to the digital euro. However, this alternative would be demanding to create, the report argues. “Digital euro holdings and transactions could only be managed in a decentralised way if it were possible to ensure that they were processed in line with central bank requirements at all times,” it says.

The decentralised option would require the Eurosystem to develop a new decentralised infrastructure with adequate security and processing capacity. This “would require significant resources and could pose various challenges as a result of the adoption of frontier technologies”, says the report. “However, the Eurosystem’s operational burden could be potentially reduced by eliminating centralised processes.”
