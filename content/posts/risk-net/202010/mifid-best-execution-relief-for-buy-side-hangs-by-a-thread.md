{{< quote steelblue >}}_Largest grouping in European Parliament faces uphill battle to suspend RTS 28 reporting_{{< /quote >}}

Legislators in the European Parliament have put forward an amendment in a Covid-19 recovery package to suspend best execution reporting for buy-side firms under Europe’s markets rules – but lawmakers opposed to the measure could yet block the amendment.

On July 24, the European Commission released draft rules making targeted amendments to various pieces of European Union legislation, with the aim of aiding the bloc’s recovery following the coronavirus crisis. Dubbed the capital markets recovery package, the draft rules propose suspending the obligation under the second [Markets in Financial Instruments Directive](https://www.fx-markets.com/topics/mifid-ii) (Mifid II) for trading venues and systematic internalisers (SIs) to publish quarterly best execution reports.

So-called Regulatory Technical Standard (RTS) 27 reports publicly disclose the price, costs, speed and likelihood of execution for various financial instruments. The planned relief measure is supposed to reduce the administrative burden on venues and SIs.

Markus Ferber, a member of the European Parliament (MEP) and of the Group of the European People’s Party (EPP), is rapporteur responsible for steering the changes to Mifid II through parliament, has put forward an amendment to extend the suspension of best execution reporting to RTS 28, which covers authorised investment firms – including dealers and asset managers.

“The commission proposal to only suspend one part of the best execution reporting requirement, but leave in place the rules that are most burdensome for intermediaries, lacks internal consistency,” says Ferber in an email to Risk.net.

“The logical thing to do would be to suspend both obligations, for venues and for intermediaries.”

Every year, investment firms must detail the top-five counterparties or venues they execute their client orders with in each financial instrument asset class and the proportion of their trading going to each dealer or venue. Buy-side firms have [long complained](https://www.fx-markets.com/regulation/7662961/buy-side-hopes-for-best-execution-reporting-carve-out) the RTS 28 reports are unnecessary because their investors do not use the reports.

“Ferber’s report was very encouraging, particularly on RTS 28 reports,” says Adam Jacobs-Dean, a managing director at hedge fund lobby group the Alternative Investment Management Association (Aima).

“That was the big omission for us when it came to the commission’s proposals of limiting the temporary suspension to RTS 27 reports. We felt it was exactly the same case that you could make in respect of RTS 28 reports, which our members are fairly critical of because they just don’t see any investor interest in the information.”

An [industry survey](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4718200/Cappitech%20MiFID%20II%20&%20Best%20Execution%20Industry%20Survey.pdf) last year by compliance and regulatory technology firm Cappitech found 72.4% of respondents were not using RTS 28 reports to make trading decisions. More than half of respondents were not reviewing other firms’ RTS 28 data.

“I would have thought that RTS 28 would be suspended in the same way that RTS 27 was or is proposed to be – the question is whether anyone is looking at the stuff in the first place,” says Nathaniel Lalone, a partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman.

### Not so fast

However, Ferber of the EPP group faces an uphill battle to get the amendment into the final law, as shadow rapporteurs representing the second-largest party, the Socialist and Democrats (S&D), and the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) tell Risk.net they oppose the amendment.

The European Parliament is due to vote on the package on October 27.

“I have not the impression that there is a lot of appetite in my group to support the rapporteur’s amendment,” says an adviser to Eero Heinäluoma, an MEP for the S&D.

“There is the belief that these reports under RTS 28 are important, as they help to understand how investment firms choose their venues for execution and how they deliver on their best execution obligations.”

Derk Jan Eppink, an MEP representing the ECR, says it doesn’t view the obligation as overly burdensome, and that it provides key information for investment firm’s clients.

“This last proposal goes beyond the proposal of the commission, and we do not support the suspension for RTS 28,” he says in an email to Risk.net.

“The obligation to produce an external summary based on the internal reports on the quality of order execution is not much burden and commits to transparency for clients and other stakeholders like consumer organisations or investment comparison websites.”

RTS 27 reports require [far more information](https://www.risk.net/regulation/mifid/2432185/mifid-ii-threatens-best-execution-data-nightmare) to be collected by venues and to be published quarterly, rather than annually. For each market segment and financial instrument trading venues and SIs executed, they must provide information on outages, auctions and failed trades for each trading day. They must also detail the average price at which an instrument was executed within specific time periods throughout each trading day. Eppink says RTS 28 is much less burdensome by comparison, and lawyers agree with that assessment.

“It’s quite difficult to compare RTS 27 and 28 reports because they are really quite different,” says Karen Cooper, a lawyer at Linklaters. “RTS 27 reports are very granular, with very specific information on price, cost, speed and likelihood of execution broken out for different financial instruments.”

Tim Cant, a partner at law firm Ashurst, says the two are “night and day”.

“RTS 27 requires an SI or venue to look at each transaction, when it was carried out, average time of executions, average cost and average speed of execution – it’s completely different to just listing the top-five places a firm executes at,” he says.

“Relieving people of RTS 27 is a smaller segment of the market, but there’s a more onerous obligation, and the data’s not particularly helpful.”

Moreover, buy-side firms that are meant to be benefiting from the RTS 27 reports also say there are other, easier ways to get the relevant information from their brokers. By contrast, Cooper of Linklaters says there is no clear alternative to RTS 28 reports for retail investors – and that could explain why some lawmakers are reluctant to extend the suspension.

“Feedback from buy-side firms is that many are getting the [RTS 27] information in different ways – for example, through meetings with their brokers – rather than going and finding it on websites,” she tells Risk.net.

“On the other hand, retail investors might directly benefit from RTS 28 reports and might not have the same leverage to obtain the information through different means. This is probably one of the reasons why there is more pushback on RTS 28 reports being suspended.”

However, Katten’s Lalone suggests that RTS 27 being more burdensome isn’t a particularly good argument for keeping the obligation on investment firms to report RTS 28 reports that aren’t widely used either.

“While it is true that RTS 27 does require more to be published and therefore it is a heavier data lift for execution venues, it doesn’t make RTS 28 more fit for purpose because it is less bad,” says Lalone.

### Tight margins

Ferber of the EPP has found support from the Identity and Democracy (ID) group. An adviser for MEP Gunnar Beck says the group has always been sceptical of the red tape imposed by Mifid II, and states that it welcomes the change as a way to cut compliance costs and end the production of unwanted information.

“According to us, there is a clear difference between the necessity of obliging investment firms to draw up a policy for their order execution that is clear and sufficiently detailed in an understandable manner for the client on the one hand, and a requirement for investment firms to publish annually per category of financial instrument and per type of client the top-five venues where they execute client orders on the other,” says the adviser in an email to Risk.net.

The ID group’s support isn’t enough to guarantee the amendment will make its way into the parliament’s final draft rules.

Together, the EPP and ID groups represent 37.4% of the parliament, which is short of a majority to carry the amendment through. The S&D and ECR opposing the amendment represent 31.8% of parliament.

Passage of the amendment will therefore depend on whether the other political parties agree to Ferber’s amendment. Risk.net contacted the rapporteurs representing centrist group Renew Europe and the Greens, but neither commented in time for the publication of this article.

If Renew Europe were to support the amendment, then it would pass by a whisker. Green support alone wouldn’t be enough unless the smaller European United Left-Nordic Green Left or non-attached members of parliament also threw their weight behind it. The Greens usually favour strong financial regulation and investor protection, making their support for Ferber unlikely in any case.

Ferber will also need to get the Council of the EU’s support for the amendment once trialogue negotiations among the three EU legislators begin. Discussions in the Council of the EU concluded on October 16, and its mandate for trialogue negotiations did not include the suspension of RTS 28.

“The council’s compromise has now been published, and it does not support suspension of RTS 28 reporting,” says Linklaters’ Cooper.

“And there appears to be an influential block of MEPs in the European Parliament who are pushing back on Ferber’s proposal, so it seems to us more likely that Ferber’s proposal to suspend RTS 28 reporting will fall.”
