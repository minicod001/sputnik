Societe Generale experienced the largest operational risk loss in June, bringing the total paid by firms in 2018 for Libor manipulation to $1.25 billion. SocGen reached settlements totalling [$750 million](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7736-18) with the US Department of Justice and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission after admitting that senior executives had ordered its US dollar Libor submissions to be falsely deflated between May 2010 and October 2011 so that it could borrow money at a more favourable interest rate.

In addition, SocGen employees in Tokyo and London were found to have colluded in 2006 to manipulate the firm’s yen Libor submissions to benefit the trading positions of a co-worker. SocGen will pay $275 million to the DoJ and $475 million to the CFTC in regulatory penalties and disgorgement.

SocGen also incurred last month’s second biggest loss, in settlements totalling [$583.8 million](https://www.societegenerale.com/en/content/societe-generale-reaches-agreements-doj-cftc-and-pnf-resolve-their-pending-ibor-and-libya-3) with the DoJ and France’s financial prosecutor’s office, PNF, over an alleged bribery scheme in Libya. Between 2004 and 2009, the firm paid bribes to high-level Libyan officials through a local broker to secure a total of $3.66 billion in investments made by Libyan state institutions. SocGen earned around $523 million in profits through the scheme, paying the broker more than $90 million in commissions, which was used for inducements to the Libyan officials.

PNF levied a fine of €250.2 million ($291.6 million). The DoJ imposed a separate $585 million penalty, but half of this amount was credited towards the PNF’s fine.

The third largest loss also concerns the Libyan bribery scheme, as US asset manager Legg Mason reached a [$64.2 million](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/legg-mason-inc-agrees-pay-64-million-criminal-penalties-and-disgorgement-resolve-fcpa-charges) agreement with the DoJ over its role. Between 2004 and 2012, around half of the Libyan investments that SocGen obtained through bribes was channelled through Legg Mason subsidiary, Permal Group. Although the DoJ acknowledged that Legg Mason did not itself have any direct contact with Libyan officials, or the broker, Permal earned around $31.6 million from the investments.

The fourth largest loss last month was another settlement with the US DoJ. Credit Suisseagreed to pay a [$47 million](https://www.credit-suisse.com/corporate/en/articles/media-releases/credit-suisse-hong-kong-ltd-reaches-a-non-prosecution-agreement--201806.html) penalty to end the DoJ’s five-year probe into its improper hiring practices in the Asia-Pacific region. Credit Suisse allegedly hired the sons and daughters of politically influential Chinese families between 2007 and 2013 in order to obtain business, in potential violation of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

Finally, cryptocurrency exchange Coinrailsuffered a cyber attack during which hackers stole an estimated [40 billion won](https://www.coindesk.com/coinrail-exchange-hacked-loses-possibly-40-million-in-cryptos/) ($37.2 million) of mixed cryptocurrencies from its holdings. The assets use the Ethereum blockchain for their transactions, and the amount stolen represented 30% of Coinrail’s token reserves. Two-thirds of the stolen tokens were frozen before they could be sold, and Coinrail moved the remaining reserves to a cold wallet, held offline, following the attack.

### Mid-year review: conduct and cyber to the fore

Conduct failings accounted for the vast majority of operational risk losses at financial institutions in the first half of 2018.

In this year’s [stress test](http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/2106649/2018+EU-wide+stress+test+-+Methodological+Note.pdf) exercise, the European Banking Authority defines conduct events as those that align with the Basel categories of ‘Internal fraud’ or ‘Clients, products and business practices’. More than half of the events recorded by ORX News between January and June fall into those two categories.

In April, US regulators fined Wells Fargo [$1 billion](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/bureau-consumer-financial-protection-announces-settlement-wells-fargo-auto-loan-administration-and-mortgage-practices/) for breaching the Consumer Financial Protection Act in its administration of auto insurance and interest rate lock periods on mortgages.

Australian authorities have embarked on a series of conduct risk actions. For example, an ongoing [Royal Commission](https://financialservices.royalcommission.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx) is investigating misconduct in the financial services industry. And on May 1, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ordered Commonwealth Bank of Australia to hold an additional [$750 million](https://www.apra.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/apra-releases-cba-prudential-inquiry-final-report-accepts-eu) in capital after the regulator found complacency with regard to non-financial risks, including failings in advice and money laundering compliance.

Although the order to hold additional capital did not represent a loss, the scope of the regulator’s attention made this of significant interest to risk professionals. Apra identified a range of oversight failings up to board level, rather than focusing on issues relating to a single product line or process. CBA was also fined approximately [$550 million](http://www.austrac.gov.au/media/media-releases/austrac-and-cba-agree-700m-penalty) in June for money laundering failures.

Conduct risk does not always relate to retail customers. As shown above, US and European regulators fined Societe Generale [$860 million](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/soci-t-g-n-rale-sa-agrees-pay-860-million-criminal-penalties-bribing-gaddafi-era-libyan) for paying bribes to officials in Libya between 2004 and 2009.

RBS’s [$4.9 billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-royal-bank-scot-settlement/rbs-reaches-4-9-billion-deal-to-settle-u-s-mortgage-bond-probe-idUSKBN1IA3L0) settlement with the US Department of Justice over mis-selling mortgage-backed securities resolved a major outstanding litigation issue for the UK bank. But the rigging of benchmark rates continues to have an impact in settlements, in some cases 10 years after the original malpractice. For example, Citibank’s [$100 million](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/citi_settlement_agreement.pdf) settlement with 42 US states over Libor manipulation harks back to events in 2008.

The insurance sector accounted for three of the 50 largest events. The embezzlement of [75 billion yuan](http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2139232/anbangs-ex-chairman-goes-trial-china-cracks-down-freewheeling) ($11.3 billion) by the former chairman of Chinese insurer Anbang was the single highest operational risk event in the first half of 2018.

Cyber risk also continues to be close to the top of many risk managers’ [list of priorities](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5424761/top-10-operational-risks-for-2018). Overall, ORX News recorded 49 cyber-related events in the first half of 2018. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, effective from May 25, imposes more reporting requirements on financial firms, and could expose new areas of vulnerability for would-be cyber attackers in the second half of the year.

Weaknesses in interbank payment systems continue to cause [losses](https://www.risk.net/comment/5675911/op-risk-data-mexico-bank-hack-fuels-global-payment-network-fears) to firms with less sophisticated security systems. Payment instructions sent via the Swift messaging network enabled the large-scale external fraud that was reported by Punjab National Bank in February. The firm later estimated its total liabilities from the fraud at [$2.2 billion](https://www.pnbindia.in/downloadprocess.aspx?fid=qTvsjnzvILodoPNEqn9wCQ==).

Swift was also the conduit for the theft of [$10 million](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/32231/banco-de-chile-lost-10-million-while-battling-virus-infection) from Banco De Chile in May. In this case, hackers used malware to cause widespread disruption to the bank’s branch network and online services to distract from the theft.

Other cyber attacks carried out on banks include ransom demands in Canada on BMO and CIBC, following the [Simplii](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/simplii-data-hack-1.4680575)data hack; and the creation of falsified bank email addresses in Italy, leading to customers’ accounts being [accessed](https://www.wired.it/attualita/2018/05/08/truffa-pec-banca-online-home-banking/).
