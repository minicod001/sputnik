{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Strategies miss recovery from March plunge, prompting rethink on speed of mean reversion_{{< /quote >}}

Credit alternative risk premia strategies that size positions based on volatility came unstuck in March – deleveraging when the coronavirus tumult struck but then missing out on the market recovery in April. The episode has led bankers to ask whether volatility scaling – a standard feature of alternative risk premia strategies across asset classes – makes sense for credit.

The “biggest differentiator by far” in the performance of credit strategies that JP Morgan offers or monitors has been the underlying portfolio construction and “in particular the use of volatility targeting”, said Danny White, the bank’s head of credit index structuring.

Strategies without volatility scaling recovered most of their losses and are roughly flat for the year, White said. The same strategies with volatility scaling have recovered only around 25% of their drawdowns, he said. White was speaking at a Risk.net webinar on July 1.

Alternative risk premia products use systematic trading methods familiar to hedge funds to target persistent sources of return. Volatility scaling is a common technique, with managers adding to or cutting exposure depending on a chosen metric of market volatility. But experts have cautioned against using some measures of volatility to scale investments, saying they are [too simplistic](https://www.risk.net/asset-management/6667656/volatility-scaling-unravels-as-market-patterns-shift) and often fail to capture the way that markets rise and fall.

Credit instruments are also different from the assets that alt risk premia strategies were first built for, White said. For structural reasons the asset class mean-reverts quicker than others. As a result, strategies that cut positions deeply when markets get choppy risk missing out on a rapid rebound, as happened in April, he said.

Except in the case of defaults, investors know the value of credit instruments at maturity. Corporate bonds and credit derivatives, therefore, tend to stick closer to fundamental value compared with equities or commodities that can stay over- or undervalued for [years](https://www.risk.net/asset-management/5460996/market-mean-reversion-takes-longer-than-expected-cfm-quants). The most widely used credit instruments tend also to have shorter maturities than rates products, White said, and their lower duration means they revert faster than longer-dated government bonds and interest rate derivatives.

Central bank action to stabilise markets has fuelled the effect, he added. “Buy the dip has been the mentality in almost every selloff in the past five or six years, whether that was Brexit, whether that was December 2018, whether it was Trump’s election in 2016, and then in March and April this year,” White said.

The US Federal Reserve announced in late March it would start buying investment grade corporate bonds and credit exchange-traded funds, and it extended those plans in early April to include lower grade credits.

The iTraxx Europe Main credit index widened by 96 basis points in 18 business days from February 21 to March 18, the largest widening on record in such a short space of time. The next 17 business days saw a 62bp tightening, the second biggest move tighter over such a short period. By comparison, in the global financial crisis the biggest move wider over the same period was 72bp.

“This was an extreme move wider followed immediately by an extreme move tighter,” White said.

A measure of rolling 30-day volatility in the iTraxx Crossover return index from Markit was around 3% at the end of 2019 but rose to 30% at the end of March before falling back to around 13% now, said Anthony Morris, head of quantitative strategies at Nomura. A strategy scaled to a target volatility of 10% using such a metric could have levered three-times going into the selloff.

Morris cautioned against assuming mean reversion is necessarily faster in credit, or if it even exists in some cases. For example, the credit spread of a BBB index may appear to be mean-reverting, but the returns from owning BBB bonds may not be mean-reverting. The reason is that bond returns will reflect the severe price declines of discarded fallen angels while index credit spreads will not, Morris said.

He agreed, however, that volatility scaling can cause unexpected underperformance in credit strategies: “Vol scaling can be a really bad idea in assets that experience massive changes in volatility quickly, and credit is a perfect example of that. In normal market conditions credit has almost no volatility. Then all of a sudden it jumps. That big increase triggers vol-scaled strategies to scale back so hard that there would be little way to benefit from a recovery if it were to happen quickly.”

Some alt risk premia strategies have [struggled](https://www.risk.net/investing/quant-investing/7537631/alt-risk-premia-chasing-tail-beta-again) recently, though fixed income versions are seen as a [growth area](https://www.risk.net/asset-management/6491851/banks-concoct-fixed-income-alternative-premia-20) for the sector.
