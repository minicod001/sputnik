The move of the Eonia-Euribor spread into negative territory could be here to stay, say market participants, as supply and demand dynamics in the commercial paper market continue to exert downward pressure on the term benchmark.

This unusual situation first occurred in March during the coronavirus-led bout of volatility. It returned on August 6 and the spread now sits at 0.0156%, with three-month Euribor at -0.483% and three-month Eonia at -0.4674% as of August 18 (see figure 1).

A lack of commercial paper issuance is said to behind the negative spread, primarily due to a fall in Euribor fixings.

“Euribor is likely to be so negative at the moment because of some supply-and-demand imbalances in the unsecured market. Since June, money market funds and official institutions – the main investors in the commercial paper market – have probably started to buy commercial paper across tenors again after a long period of holding cash in March to May,” says Giuseppe Maraffino, senior euro rates strategist at Barclays.

“However, bank issuance of commercial paper in June and July hasn’t increased, so we now have a situation of higher demand but still low supply of unsecured securities like commercial paper. In turn, that’s created a downward pressure on unsecured rates,” he says.

A supply-and-demand imbalance wouldn’t have affected Euribor too much under its old methodology, when the rate was based on theoretical quotes provided by banks. But the new approach, which sees it underpinned by actual transactions, ensures that rate is much more sensitive to such imbalances nowadays, Maraffino adds.

If demand for commercial paper continues to outweigh the supply from banks, the Euribor-Eonia spread will remain negative for foreseeable future, he says. “As long as we have a disequilibrium between supply and demand of unsecured paper – especially during the summer when issuance is usually very low – then three-month Euribor could keep creeping down and move towards the deposit rate at -50%. Meanwhile, as the market doesn’t have expectations of further downward pressure on Eonia fixings from the expected increase in liquidity conditions, Eonia is likely to remain unchanged. As such, I would expect the basis between the two to stay marginally negative.”

While the euro forward-rate agreement/Eonia curve has already been priced in at around 6bp for 2021, which implies that a negative Euribor-Eonia basis isn’t expected to persist over the longer term, Maraffino says the market is likely pricing in the possibility of another Covid-19 lockdown in the next quarter, which could create upward pressure on the basis.

“In case of no worsening of the situation, we do not rule out that the basis could remain marginally negative,” he says.

Olek Gajowniczek, a rates trader at Nomura, says a negative spread isn’t too surprising given that an abundance of liquidity in the market has caused all rates to compress – with Euribor and Eonia therefore simply following prevailing market conditions.

“We’re in a super-excess liquidity environment now, where all of the policy accommodation has taken place in all the major central banks in the world, and the ECB is no exception. In such a super-accommodative, high-liquidity environment, all the differentials of various money market prices have begun to compress – such as the cross-currency and Libor-overnight indexed swap basis in every currency,” says Gajowniczek.

He also says few market participants would have been badly affected by a negative Euribor-Eonia spread given how liquid the basis is, meaning that anyone negatively affected by such market moves should be able to hedge themselves easily and cheaply.

“This isn’t a situation that is unheard of as the basis between Euribor and Eonia has been quite volatile for the past 10 years or so. I wouldn’t have thought there’d be any particularly obvious problems for market participants caused here. Some people may have positioned themselves believing that zero was a hard lower bound, but I suspect those are just isolated cases,” says Gajowniczek.

One rates trader at a large dealer believes the Euribor-Eonia spread will probably remain bounded between -5bp and 5bp but is likely to trend positive towards the end of this year. However, he says the spread could easily remain negative in the longer term depending on how underlying market conditions play out.
