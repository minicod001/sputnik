{{< quote steelblue >}}_Legacy Libor cross-currency swaps could move to SOFR discounting at the same time_{{< /quote >}}

Hong Kong Exchange’s OTC Clear will start clearing US dollar versus Hong Kong dollar and Chinese renminbi cross-currency basis swaps linked to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) around the second quarter of 2021.

The clearing house will also begin using SOFR to value and pay interest on cash collateral held against Libor-referencing US dollar cross-currency swaps at the same time – but only if the bilateral market has already made the switch.

“A few major banks are seeking some direction from us on what would be the rough timing [of the switch to SOFR] for cross-currency swaps, and we are looking at the end of the first quarter or [the start of] the second quarter [of 2021],” says Jacky Mak, head of business development for over-the-counter, fixed income and currency clearing at HKEX.

“We clear a significant portion of cross-currency swaps, so the market is also asking us to prepare because they want a consistent approach,” he adds.

As of September, the notional value of outstanding US dollar/Hong Kong dollar and US dollar/renminbi cross-currency swaps at OTC Clear [stood at US$137 billion](https://www.hkex.com.hk/Market-Data/Statistics/Clearing-and-Settlement-and-Depository/OTC-Clearing-and-Settlement-Statistics/Monthly-Statistics?sc_lang=en). The US dollar floating legs of these swaps currently reference Libor, while the Hong Kong dollar and renminbi floating legs are pegged to the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate, or Hibor.

Libor is due to be retired after the end of 2021. At that point, the US dollar floating legs of cross-currency swaps will need to reference its replacement rate, SOFR.

As part of the transition to SOFR, HKEX will also begin using SOFR to discount future cashflows and calculate interest payments on cash collateral, known as price alignment interest. Fed funds is currently used to perform these calculations for cleared US dollar cross-currency swaps.

HKEX, along with LCH and CME, switched to [SOFR discounting](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7700121/ccp-discount-switch-drives-record-sofr-swap-volumes) for US dollar interest rate swaps in mid-October. The so-called big bang was a response to industry calls for a co-ordinated switch, with all central counterparties that clear US dollar interest rate swaps moving to [SOFR discounting](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7700121/ccp-discount-switch-drives-record-sofr-swap-volumes) at the same time.

LCH also adopted [SOFR discounting for all cross-currency swaps](https://www.lch.com/resources/news/lch-successfully-completes-transition-sofr-discounting) registered in its SwapAgent service as part of the ‘big bang’. SwapAgent handles processing, margining and settlement of non-cleared derivatives.

But HKEX’s members have advised it to wait for the bilateral market to complete the move to SOFR discounting before applying it to cleared trades.

“We had a consultation with our member banks to see what would be the best time for the cross-currency swaps [switch to SOFR discounting],” says Mak. “There is still a significant portion of these swaps that are traded in the bilateral market, so we think it would be beneficial if all the banks start to switch the discounting for their bilateral credit support annexes as well.”

### Honia or Hibor?

In addition to switching the US dollar floating leg of cross-currency swaps to SOFR, HKEX also plans to offer members a choice of benchmark for the Hong Kong dollar and renminbi floating legs.

While there are no current plans to discontinue Hibor, a local industry group – the Treasury Markets Association – has identified Honia as an alternative risk-free rate. Hong Kong will therefore adopt a multi-rate approach, where the two benchmarks co-exist.

Mak says that while HKEX will continue to support Hibor for cross-currency swaps, it will add Honia – the Hong Kong dollar overnight index average – as a floating rate option.

The first bilateral Hong Kong dollar and renminbi cross-currency trades using Hibor and Honia versus SOFR were completed in early October. Bank of China, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Standard Chartered were involved in the transactions.

William Shek, head of credit and rates at HSBC, expects Hibor to maintain its standing as the main benchmark for USD/HKD cross-currency swaps for the time being, since it is the more liquid benchmark.

“In Hong Kong, you will see more of Hibor versus SOFR initially because of the state of the liquidity, and as the cash bond and loan markets are not yet conforming fast enough,” he says. “I think the transition of Hibor into Honia will be more gradual, but it will happen.”

Mak agrees, though he thinks the market will gravitate to cross-currency swaps that use risk-free rates – Honia and SOFR – for both legs as Libor is phased out.

“When more products start trading under SOFR and as more jurisdictions move to the RFRs, we anticipate that demand will be higher for SOFR-based cross-currency swaps, and perhaps for Honia-SOFR [cross-currency swaps] for Hong Kong,” he says.
