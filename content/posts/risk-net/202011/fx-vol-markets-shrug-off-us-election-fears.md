FX options traders spent much of the lead-up to the US presidential election worrying about what could play out if the result was delayed or disputed. As it turned out, the market reaction was remarkably calm, both on the day of the vote and the next. The FX options head at one European bank describes it as “the lull before the lull”.

While trading was quiet going into the election, volatilities were nevertheless elevated. The expectation was that they would fall as the election result became clear. Volatilities ticked up when the race seemed it could go either way, but the FX options head says the moves were muted in the circumstances.

US dollar/offshore Chinese renminbi was among the most closely followed currency pairs ahead of the vote, with one-month vols sitting at 8.8 on election day. This was expected to fall to 7.3 once the result was known, according to a note from one European bank. Traders unwound some downside USD/CNH trades from around 3am London time, supplying the market with volatility and pushing one-month volatility down to around 7.9 at the start of the trading day. But with the election still in the balance on November 4, volatility remained at that mark as of 3pm London time, according to Bloomberg data.

It was a similar story in euro/dollar, with one-month vols sitting at around 8.4 going into the election, with the expectation this would fall to 6.4 once the results were in. Vols dropped to 7.9 at the start of the London trading day on November 4 and moved down to 7.4 by 3pm as Biden’s position improved.

“Vols are higher than they were expected to roll but lower than pre-event and have been trading very soft since about 3am London time. This was supposed to be the highest vol outcome (at least for gamma). The fact the moves are contained and vols are continuing to soften is notable,” says the note.

The head of FX options at a second European bank confirms the moves were quieter than expected. Traders largely sat on their hands as the US dollar whipsawed overnight. The bank had expected the uncertainty to shift the event weighting out to Thursday or Friday for EUR/USD overnight options. The bank’s projected volatility for those days is around 1–1.5 vols higher today than it was yesterday.

But, he says, “we've seen a more muted reaction as I guess people digest and assume that we will be left with a Biden presidency and a Republican Senate and some legal contests down the road”.

That view has put a slight bid in options with dates beyond November 14 and even into early January, says the head of FX options at the second European bank. December 14, the day of the US electoral college vote, is also seeing higher overnight vols.

“The question will be whether this becomes a significant event or not over coming days and weeks as it becomes clearer what legal action will occur,” he says.

An FX options trader at a third European bank is not surprised at the quiet response. Most people are waiting for a clearer picture of the outcome before rebalancing their portfolios.  Client flows were mixed this morning, he says, and liquidity was “adequate”.

The FX options head at the first European bank says bid/offer spreads on tenors of one month and out, and currency pairs less affected by the election results, are returning to normal. But there is still insufficient depth for large volumes, he says. “Short dates are still tricky as it’s not clear when anything is resolved and what dates should have extra volatility added to it.”

The pairs that are more correlated to the election result, such as USD/CNH and dollar/Mexican peso, are still slightly jumpier, with spot and vols moving a little, says the options head at the first European bank. If the incoming results point to a Biden presidency, liquidity will return and spreads will tighten, he adds.
