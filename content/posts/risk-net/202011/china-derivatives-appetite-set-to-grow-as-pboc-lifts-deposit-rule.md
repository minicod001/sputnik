Traders are expecting increased interest in Chinese renminbi foreign exchange forwards following the decision to remove a reserve requirement ratio for financial institutions by the country’s central bank.

Worried by the soaring renminbi, on October 10 the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) announced it would scrap the FX risk reserve ratio it implemented in 2018 to curb speculation against the currency.

Under the rule, financial institutions had to set aside 20% of the previous month’s renminbi forwards settlement amount as FX risk reserves. This applied to any FX derivatives that involved exchanging onshore yuan at a future date.

Market participants say the abolition of the reserve requirement means hedging costs for Chinese companies will shrink significantly.

“The costs are likely to be around 50 basis points lower,” says a treasurer at a property developer in China. “Under the 20% deposit rule banks needed to have the US dollar reserve with the central bank for a year, and the cost would be passed to clients.”

Other traders who spoke to FX Markets say hedging costs for forwards, options and cross-currency swaps could be reduced by as much as 100bp.

While still significant, the reductions are expected to be smaller than in 2017, when the PBoC made a similar change to a rule first introduced in 2015.

“Back in 2017 the impact was larger – around 300bp – as the funding cost of the US dollar was higher at that time,” says Frankie Lau, a renminbi trader at Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.

Nonetheless, corporates in China should benefit from the lifting of the deposit rule, the treasurer says. As onshore hedging costs decline, corporates are more likely to use onshore hedging instead of going offshore, he adds.

### From strength to strength 

The reserve requirement was first introduced in 2015 when the central bank tried to contain the depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar, following a reform of its exchange rate in October of that year.

The PBoC halted the policy in 2017, in a sign it was less concerned about the depreciation of its currency. But it reinstated the requirement in August of the following year as the trade war with the US slumped the renminbi closer to 7 per dollar (see figure 1).

Since then, the renminbi has continued to strengthen, prompting last month’s intervention. The currency gained almost 5% against the dollar between May and October, on the back of a favourable yield differential between China and other major economies.

However, relief for the redback was short-lived, as the renminbi returned to gain against the dollar in the weeks following the announcement, strengthening by more than 2% in the last month alone (see figure 2).

Despite the latest PBoC’s efforts, some say the move might not have the desired effect.

“The PBoC hopes to contain the rise of the yuan but the currency’s strengthening momentum against the USD will not change, at least in the next few months,” says the treasurer.

By removing the rules that made betting against the renminbi expensive, the central bank is effectively allowing traders more room for manoeuvre. However, the decision could be short-lived if the currency depreciates too fast, too soon.

“The move is more like a signal that the central bank is concerned about the strength of the yuan and will allow more short bets,” says Lau. “However, it is possible that it might reimpose the rule in the future if the yuan weakens.”
