> _Types of loans most likely to become distressed due to coronavirus don’t suit EU-wide solution_

In recent weeks, there has been much talk of setting up a European bad bank to manage the growing non-performing loans in the banking sector resulting from the Covid-19 outbreak. Is this idea legally feasible and financially sound?

First, we should note that the eurozone banking union already has the option to set up a multilateral bad bank, meaning that the key decisions are taken by a European supranational authority with the possibility of European funding. This option is contained in the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR).

The SRMR sees the segregation of assets as an ordinary resolution tool, so the Single Resolution Board (SRB) could set up a special purpose company to operationalise that tool when it has to tackle a crisis in one or more banks.

In this case, an economic valuation is required before segregating any asset, and that valuation can imply significant losses for the transferring (resolved) bank. Who will bear these losses?

The EU’s burden-sharing rules on resolution apply, meaning the losses are absorbed by shareholders, subordinated creditors, senior bond holders and ineligible depositors (non-retail or deposits of more than €100,000) of the resolved banks. The Single Resolution Fund could contribute to funding the resolution, but only if losses equivalent to 8% of the bank’s total liabilities have already been borne by shareholders and creditors.

This option is only available to the 19 banking union members. There is one other alternative for setting up a bad bank available across the EU, but it requires a very flexible interpretation of the recently approved [temporary framework](https://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/what_is_new/covid_19.html) for state aid measures to support the economy in the current Covid-19 outbreak. In that framework, the European Commission allows state aid measures to tackle impaired assets of banks in the context of the so-called precautionary recapitalisation (article 18 of the SRMR).

Complying with the conditions spelt out in that article, a European authority such as the EC could fund a bad bank, for instance through the forthcoming EU Recovery Fund. But the transfer of assets would imply losses for the transferring bank, unless the transfer price equals their net book value – which is an unrealistic assumption.

The temporary framework establishes that the traditional burden-sharing rules applied widely in the last financial crisis (to shareholders and subordinated debt investors) are suspended. As a result, European taxpayers would bear all these losses.

This approach to creating a European bad bank would therefore end up being one of the first examples of [risk mutualisation](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5388641/tranche-warfare-uphill-struggle-for-euro-safe-bonds) among member states. Given how controversial the concept has been, this is politically unfeasible.

### National alternative
There is a more realistic alternative to set up a bad bank, but at a national level. In fact, the state aid rules have been used, so far, to tackle the problems of one or more banks in a [single member state](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5300336/public-interest-loophole-casts-doubt-on-eu-banking-union), so all the bad banks have been national.

Leaving aside the market fragmentation implied by this alternative, does a kind of European federation of national bad banks make sense? The only justification could be in the existence of economies of scale in the management of the assets. However, this seems unlikely considering the type of impaired assets banks will probably have in their balance sheets with this crisis.

The assets most likely to be impaired in the aftermath of Covid-19 are loans to small and medium enterprises and self-employed workers, as well as consumer loans. That would represent a huge number of loans, with a relatively low nominal value and mostly without valuable collateral.

This kind of asset does not fit with the usual features of assets managed by bad banks in the previous crisis, such as Spain’s Sareb and Ireland’s Nama. For example, in the case of Sareb, the Spanish authorities excluded the transfer of problematic loans below a threshold of €250,000.

Second, to set the transfer price is a very controversial task. With a very aggressive price, the authorities are anticipating huge expected losses. In this scenario, a straight sale of those impaired assets (with varying modalities) to some specialised investors focused on recoveries would be more effective.

If the price is more conservative, authorities are anticipating that those customers will progressively resume servicing the debt. In this scenario, keeping the loans on the bank balance sheet is more effective, as these customers belong to their core business.

All in all, at this point, I do not see the added value of setting up a bad bank for the long-term management of those assets and without the expertise and experience that banks have with those customers.

In conclusion, I do not see the need for – or feasibility of – setting up a European bad bank beyond the current resolution framework. The eurozone already has that tool available in the existing SRMR framework, as well as a mechanism to absorb a bad bank’s losses and the Single Resolution Fund to support putting a bad bank into place. And, perhaps most importantly, this can be achieved without the taxpayer having to foot the bill.
