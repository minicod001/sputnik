JP Morgan’s risk-of-loss estimate for its trading portfolio averaged $128 million over the second quarter, its highest level on record, and an increase of 125% on Q1.

Trading value-at-risk for fixed income positions surged the most dollar-wise quarter-on-quarter, by $69 million (+115%). Percentage-wise, commodities VAR jumped highest, by 220% to $32 million. Average foreign exchange VAR edged up 29% to $9 million and equities VAR 35% to $27 million.

In addition, credit portfolio VAR, which sits outside trading VAR, grew 114% to $22 million. This captures the risk on hedges of credit valuation adjustment and retained loan portfolios.

Overall VAR at the corporate and investment bank (CIB) benefited from a large reduction to account for netting benefits, which averaged $92 million in Q2, compared to $48 million the prior quarter.

JP Morgan posted trading revenues of $9.7 billion for Q2, almost triple the Q1 haul, and 79% up on the year-ago quarter.

### What is it?
Value-at-risk measures the potential loss due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon to a specified confidence level.

The VAR model used by JP Morgan CIB captures risks for most market-making and client-related activities, and is reported by risk type. It also takes into account the diversification of aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.

The model is calibrated to a one-day time horizon and a 95% confidence level, meaning losses should only exceed the modelled estimate one trading day out of every 20.

The VAR amounts for Q1 and Q2 2020 exclude positions linked to interest rate hedging arising from the bank’s debit valuation adjustment (DVA). Those positions would have shaved $11 million off Q2 fixed income VAR, $11 million off overall trading VAR and $8 million off VAR for the CIB as a whole.

### Why it matters
JP Morgan grabbed the opportunity afforded by the coronavirus-induced volatility in the second quarter to book record trading revenues.

Still, the profits came from taking on more risk and expanding its trading portfolio, which amounted to over $500 billion at end-June, compared to around $400 billion at the end of last year. This explains the huge leap in VAR estimates.

Don’t bet on the bank’s hot trading streak to go on, though. Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s chief executive officer, said he expected trading revenues to halve over the last six months of the year as client activity normalises. This depends, though, on whether another coronavirus-induced panic can be avoided over the coming months.
