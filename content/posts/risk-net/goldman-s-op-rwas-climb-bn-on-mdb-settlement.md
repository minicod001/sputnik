Operational risk-weighted assets (RWAs) surged 12% to $132.5 billion at Goldman Sachs over the three months to end-June, anticipating the supersized [settlement](https://www.goldmansachs.com/media-relations/press-releases/current/announcement-24-july-2020.html) reached with the Malaysian government in July over the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) fraud.

It’s the highest level climbed by Goldman’s op RWAs on record, and the biggest one-quarter increase since Q4 2015. The jump accounted for nearly two-thirds of the overall increase in [advanced approaches RWAs](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7655651/modelled-rwas-diverge-from-standardised-at-goldman-sachs) at the bank over Q2.

In its quarterly filing, Goldman said the “vast majority” of the increase was linked to “litigation and regulatory proceedings” – of which the 1MDB case was the most significant outstanding. Total cash set aside to cover these proceedings amounted to almost $3 billion in Q2.

On July 24, Goldman agreed to pay [$2.5 billion](https://www.risk.net/comment/7664751/op-risk-data-goldman-1mdb-settlement-swells-2020-loss-tally) to resolve the 1MDB proceedings and to return at least $1.4 billion in gains made from assets linked to 1MDB.

Among other US global systemically important banks (G-Sibs), only Wells Fargo also saw its op RWAs increase quarter-on-quarter, by 1% to $340.2 billion.

State Street saw its op RWAs fall the most percentage-wise over the three months to end-June, by 5% to $44.2 billion.

### What is it?

Basel II rules lay out three methods by which banks can calculate their capital requirements for operational risk: the basic indicator approach; the standardised approach; and the advanced measurement approach (AMA). The first two use bank data inputs and regulator-set formulas to generate the required capital, while the AMA allows banks to use their own models to produce the outputs.

### Why it matters

Op risk rules mean Goldman was hit with a one-two punch on settling the 1MDB case. Not only did it have to pay out a huge sum of cash to settle proceedings, the bank also had to include the loss in its AMA model, which produced record-high op RWA amounts, equivalent to a regulatory capital charge of some $10.6 billion.

However, the regulatory capital burden of op risk may no longer preoccupy Goldman, or any US G-Sib, for that. Why? Because of the introduction of the [stress capital buffer](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7566911/us-banks-face-capital-hit-from-resurgent-advanced-approaches), the Federal Reserve’s new methodology for setting minimum capital requirements. The SCB is calculated off of banks’ standardised RWAs only. Since the standardised approach does not include op risk, Goldman and its peer banks are technically not bound by their op RWAs if their capital requirement is higher under the SCB than the old advanced approaches capital conservation buffer.

Still, things will change once the finalised Basel III package is fully implemented, and a souped-up op risk methodology is included in the revised standardised approach. This means the capital hangover of the 1MDB scandal could linger for many years.
