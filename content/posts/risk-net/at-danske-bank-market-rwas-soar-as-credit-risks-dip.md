Danske Bank’s market risk-weighted assets (RWAs) ballooned 36% in Q2 in response to whipsawing markets. In contrast, those linked to credit and counterparty exposures dropped quarter-on-quarter, as the lender factored in the risk-dampening effects of regulatory interventions by European policymakers.

Market RWAs as of end-June totalled DKK 58.4 billion ($9 billion), which equates to a market risk capital charge of DKK 4.7 billion. Three months prior, these RWAs amounted to DKK 43.1 billion.

Higher value-at-risk (VAR) levels pushed RWAs up over the quarter. Average VAR for trading-related activities in Q2 hit DKK 39 million, up from DKK 26 million in Q1.

The regulatory VAR-based capital charge climbed in tandem, up 59% quarter-on-quarter to DKK 2.2 billion, as did the stress VAR-based measure: 28% to DKK 2.1 billion.

The bank attributed these increases to “higher interest rate risk and bond spread risk”. Danske’s net trading assets hit DKK 113.7 billion at end-June, up from DKK 103.5 billion three months prior. The firm said the increase was due to a build-up of bond holdings.

In contrast to the market risk capital charge, the bank’s credit risk capital requirement fell by less than half a percentage point to DKK 47.6 billion and its counterparty credit risk charge 7% to DKK 3.3 billion.

### What is it?

Danske Bank’s market risk capital requirements under the internal model approach are the sum of three separate charges: a VAR-based measure; a stressed VAR-based measure; and an incremental risk requirement.

VAR measures the potential loss due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon to a specified confidence level. Danske’s internal management VAR is calculated at a 95% confidence interval over a one-day holding period.

In contrast, regulatory VAR is calculated at a 99% confidence level assuming a 10-day holding period.

The stressed VAR-based measure uses the same regulatory model fed with historical data from a 12-month period of significant financial stress.

The incremental risk charge is meant to cover a bank’s estimate of the default and migration risk of unsecuritised credit products.

### Why it matters

Danske’s results illustrate the powerful effect that targeted regulatory relief, mandated by European Union authorities, has had on bank capital.

Though the net value of credit exposures held by the bank hit DKK 3.1 trillion at end-June, up some 4% on three months prior, credit RWAs pared back somewhat thanks to the Capital Requirements Regulation “quick fix” passed in June, which eased charges for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises and infrastructure exposures. It also allowed state guarantees introduced for loans affected by the coronavirus to contribute more towards minimum coverage requirements.

Without this relief, the Danske’s credit RWAs would have undoubtedly been higher.

European policymakers also eased market risk requirements, by temporarily freezing increases to the [multipliers](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7531061/eu-market-risk-relief-targets-var-measures) applied to VAR-based capital charges. These are supposed to ratchet up as VAR-backtesting exceptions occur. Without this relief, it’s possible Danske could have posted a much higher market risk capital charge.

Though these coronavirus-induced amendments to regulatory rules have taken some of the strain off of banks’ capital ratios, they may also make it harder for investors to understand which lenders are holding up well through the crisis, and which are only struggling through thanks to the EU’s targeted relief.
