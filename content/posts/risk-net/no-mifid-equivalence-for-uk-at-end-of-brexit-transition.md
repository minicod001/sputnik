> _Footnote reveals assessment delay beyond January 2021, piling pressure on London-based firms_

The European Commission will not initiate an assessment vital to preserving cross-border trading between the European Union and UK, citing an incomplete legal framework that prevents EU authorities from starting the process.

The revelation, contained in a footnote to a stakeholder communication published by the EC on July 9, dashes any remaining hopes that firms based in the UK would be given cross-border access to EU financial markets by the end of 2020, when the Brexit transition period is due to end.

“We thought both sides would kick off on all areas of equivalence,” says an industry source. “So quite frankly it was a bit of a surprise to see the communication from the EC. When we got to footnote 21, there were quite a few raised eyebrows.”

If the EC deems the rules in a specific country to be equivalent, firms based in that jurisdiction can access EU markets more easily. But the footnote states that the EC hasn’t begun equivalence assessments where the relevant EU legal framework is not fully in place. Equivalence decisions for these areas will not be adopted in the “short or medium term”, according to the footnote.

The list of delayed assessments includes article 47 in the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (Mifir), which allows investment firms in third-country jurisdictions to access clients and counterparties in the whole of the EU market if granted. Without Mifir [equivalence](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7404916/the-uk-path-to-eu-equivalence-detente-or-detour), UK firms will only be able to service EU clients if they are granted [national exemptions](https://www.risk.net/regulation/6171091/banks-warned-on-holes-in-eus-proposed-brexit-relief) in the local laws of each client’s jurisdiction, or if they set up subsidiaries that are fully regulated by an EU jurisdiction.

EU and UK officials are currently undertaking assessments of each other’s regulations to potentially grant various positive equivalence determinations. A non-binding political declaration published in October 2019 stated that both sides would endeavour to conclude equivalence assessments before the end of June this year.

So far, however, no equivalence determinations have been granted, with UK and EU negotiators accusing each other of hindering the assessments process. The EU accuses the UK of being too slow to submit responses to its questionnaires. The UK accuses the EU of submitting bulky questionnaires too late.

### Same game, new rules

The equivalence determination for cross-border services is outlined in Mifir, which accompanies the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ([Mifid II](https://www.risk.net/topics/markets-in-financial-instruments-directive-mifid)). Article 46 of Mifir allows third-country firms to provide cross-border services to clients and counterparties across the EU, if the EC deems the jurisdiction is equivalent under article 47 of the same regulation.

A jurisdiction must have similar rules to the ones laid down in the EU’s Mifir and Mifid II, as well as [bank](https://www.risk.net/topics/capital-requirements-directive-crd) and non-[bank](https://www.risk.net/topics/capital-requirements-directive-crd) prudential requirements, for the EC to deem it equivalent for the purposes of article 47.

A positive determination would allow UK dealers to trade with EU clients and counterparties using their own capital, operate venues classed as either multilateral or organised trading facilities, underwrite financial instruments, provide investment advice and receive and transmit orders on behalf of clients, among other activities. Asset managers can also undertake those Mifid II activities that are relevant to their business, as well as providing portfolio management.

The EU adopted a series of [amendments](https://www.risk.net/regulation/6532576/new-eu-rules-threaten-to-lock-out-us-prop-traders) to Mifir’s third-country access provisions in November 2019, partly in response to the UK’s decision to leave the EU. The [amendments](https://www.risk.net/regulation/6532576/new-eu-rules-threaten-to-lock-out-us-prop-traders) were bolted on to rules establishing capital requirements for non-bank investment firms, known as the Investment Firms Regulation (IFR).

If firms in a third country are likely to have systemic importance for the EU – as is the case with many in London, which has acted as an EU-wide financial centre – the EC must undertake a “detailed and granular” assessment of the country’s rules. This forensic examination under the IFR amendments is likely to be more difficult for the UK to pass than the original Mifir equivalence test.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) is currently drafting regulatory technical standards (RTS), which provide extra details on the information third-country firms must submit to the regulator.

Sources had already told Risk.net the unfinished nature of the IFR framework put a [question mark](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7411141/new-mifid-equivalence-rules-leave-uk-firms-in-limbo) over how and when the EC would approach the equivalence assessment with the UK. The recent stakeholder communication provides official confirmation of this delay.

### Off the table

The footnote has caused irritation in the industry. A regulatory expert at a global investment bank says they had been expecting the EC to make the assessment under the existing Mifir article 47 framework, which is long established rather than being a work in progress.

“It’s not consistent with my broader understanding of how this works. The broad expectation was that the EU either will or won’t make an equivalence determination on the entirety of Mifir,” says the regulatory expert. “If they do grant equivalence, then that will get revised when the IFR comes in. But certainly there is a legal framework for them to do equivalence, and that is article 47.”

Four sources say the communication effectively takes article 47 equivalence off the table for the end of the transition period on December 31 this year. Until then, UK financial institutions are treated as if they are in the single market – but after that date, they become third-country firms.

“They’re basically saying, in the short or medium term: ‘don’t get your hopes up’,” says Nathaniel Lalone, a partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman.

Moreover, it is unclear when the new article 47 legal framework will be in place. The IFR comes into force on June 26, 2021, but Esma has been given a longer time period to complete its draft RTS, which it must submit to the EC by September 26, 2021. Esma has, however, already completed a consultation on the RTS, which closed on March 31, and is reviewing responses.

The EC will also have to undertake an assessment of the UK’s legal framework to check if it is actually equivalent, a process for which there is no set time limit.

### Not like clearing

In the July 9 communication, the EC indicated it was considering a time-limited equivalence deal for UK central counterparties. As with Mifir article 47, the [European Market Infrastructure Regulation](https://www.risk.net/topics/emir) (Emir) was also recently amended to [beef up](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7245111/clearing-experts-fear-tough-ec-stance-on-emir-22) the equivalence rules for CCPs in response to the UK’s decision to leave the bloc. Those rules also provide Esma with powers over third-country clearing houses deemed to be systemically important.

But the EC hasn’t finalised drafting all of the RTSs surrounding CCP equivalence determinations and is unlikely to have those in place before the end of this year. This is what has prompted the EC to consider a temporary equivalence deal.

The industry source points to the contradiction between the EC’s stance on CCP equivalence and access for investment firms. Both equivalence frameworks are not fully in place, yet the EC will only consider a temporary deal for Emir, not for Mifir article 47.

But the EC has more reason to grant equivalence for UK CCPs, says Katten Muchin’s Lalone. The forced mass migration of all EU clearing members and clients away from UK clearing houses – LCH, Ice Clear Europe and the LME – [would likely](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7652906/eus-brexit-clearing-grab-slow-to-lift-off) raise financial stability issues. By contrast, the main impact of restricting access for UK investment firms to their EU clients under Mifir would be to force businesses to move staff from London to the continent to service those clients.

“The EU will provide equivalence when it’s in its own interest,” says Lalone. “Permitting UK investment firms to maintain effectively untrammelled access to the EU wholesale financial markets is a market access issue, which doesn’t really go to issues of financial stability. It’s also one of the key pieces of leverage on the EU side that it wouldn’t be diplomatically smart to give away just yet.”

### Political cover

The contrasting behaviour of the EC over Mifir and Emir suggests to market participants that the incomplete legal framework is not the only reason the EU is delaying its article 47 equivalence assessment. While negotiations on the post-Brexit trade agreement with the UK are ongoing, it is in the EU’s interests not to concede too much to the UK too soon.

“Even if the Commission justifies this is on the basis that the IFR equivalence provisions are still in-flight, I think that’s a bit of a red herring,” says Lalone of Katten Muchin. “I don’t know that they were ever going to actually provide equivalence on article 47 so early because, if they did, there goes all of the EU’s leverage in terms of market access.”

EC officials have been relatively transparent about that in recent months. In a prepared statement sent to Risk.net by a spokesperson, EC executive vice-president for financial services Valdis Dombrovskis says: “Our decisions will be based on a comprehensive assessment, including of the EU’s interest.”

A partner at a law firm says the use of the phrase “medium term” could offer some clue as to when the EC may begin contemplating whether to use the equivalence determination – and the answer is not encouraging.

“What does this concept of medium term mean?” asks the partner. “That is probably where some debate lies about: at what point do the politics of this settle down and become less acrimonious? That is clearly not this year. It is probably not even next year either judging from the communication.”

The EC declined to clarify how long it envisages the “medium term” to last. The partner at the law firm believes the earliest the EC may begin to consider equivalence will be 2022. But even then, there is no guarantee that equivalence will be granted, because the assessment [doesn’t rest solely](https://www.risk.net/our-take/7448216/why-bankers-should-embrace-the-brexit-political-theatre) on legal systems being in place or aligned.

“The UK has not only implemented [the rules], but was part of negotiating [them] and was until last year a member of the European Union, and has been complying with the rules in the transition period,” says the partner. “There is no legal reason why equivalence cannot be granted, but that is a slightly blinkered view and you’d have to be living down a hole to think that argument has any traction or any real chance with the EU. This is political.”
