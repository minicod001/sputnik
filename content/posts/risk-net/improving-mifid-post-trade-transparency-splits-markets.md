{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Mooted changes to Europe’s transparency regime are dividing markets – largely along functional lines_{{< /quote >}}

It’s uncontroversial to say that financial markets transparency in Europe has so far failed. Launched in 2018, the current transparency regime has created fixed income and derivatives [trade data that is mostly unusable](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5532211/mifid-data-hard-to-access-hard-to-use), say participants.

But while everyone agrees the regime must be improved, no-one agrees on how. The thorniest issue now splintering the market is whether to alter the timing of post-trade publication.

Hedge funds and data vendors see advantage in recalibrating the regime so more trade data is disclosed far sooner.

But banks don’t agree. Instead, they say, regulators and legislators should find ways to improve the utility of the current data.

Trading venues, meanwhile, are diplomatically sitting out the debate in an effort not to displease either side.

“It’s up to the buy side and sell side to fight this out among themselves,” says a regulatory expert at a trading venue. “It’s up to them to determine what happens next.”

Mifid II, the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, extended the post-trade transparency regime to bond and derivatives markets – a regime that its predecessor, Mifid I, applied only to equities – with the aim of giving investors more information.

The regime requires the price and quantity of individual trades executed off- and on-venue to be publicly disseminated either through [Approved Publication Arrangements](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7247631/mifids-free-data-mirage-vexes-markets) (APA) or by the venue through which it was executed.

The obligation falls on European Union venues to publish all transactions executed on their platforms. Off-venue trades must be reported to APAs either by large dealers, classed as systematic internalisers (SIs), or by an EU investment firm if an SI is not involved.

On March 10, the European Securities and Markets Authority published a consultation paper setting out ways to improve Mifid II’s transparency regime – by simplifying the rules and making more information available. Esma’s consultation will inform it and legislators on [what changes](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7154086/why-europes-markets-might-need-mifid-iii) to make to Mifid II.

But some say that recalibrating at this point is putting the cart before the horse, since the transparency regime has not yet been fully implemented.

### Not agreeing to defer

The Esma consultation presents an array of options for altering deferrals to post-trade transparency rules, a factor many blame for [Mifid II’s failings](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5466251/mifid-transparency-has-failed-so-far-say-traders).

Mifid II allows the publication of all information on a trade to be delayed if it is larger than one of two size thresholds – or if it involves an instrument deemed by Esma to be illiquid.

A ‘large-in-scale’ (LIS) deferral is given if the trade is larger than the average size of trades within that asset class. A ‘size-specific-to-instrument’ (SSTI) deferral is granted to transactions that are larger than a minimum size threshold but smaller than the LIS threshold – and only if the trade involves a dealer using its own capital while trading off-venue or on a request-for-quote venue.

Deferrals can vary enormously, depending on the trading jurisdiction. For example, in Denmark and the German state of Hesse – home to derivatives exchange Eurex – maximum deferrals are often two days, while in the UK and the rest of Germany, deferrals lasting four weeks are granted in all circumstances.

Deferrals are intended to provide dealers enough time to hedge a trade before its details leak to the market and competitors can then move the market against them, disrupting the ability to hedge.

The problem for users of the data is that the more information and the longer it is deferred, the fewer its uses. Real-time information could be used by traders to take intraday snapshots of market prices and trade volumes, or to help pricing and hedging algorithms.

Deferred data is too stale to inform current trading prices. Uses for aged data include macroeconomic analysis; as inputs into risk management models showing historical performances during backtesting, or for assessing whether a firm was able to get best execution on past trades.

The problem for Mifid II is that deferred publication is the rule and real-time publication is the exception – because the majority of instruments currently benefit from deferrals.

“Nobody looks at the data until the maximum possible deferral period is over. So, even 48 hours is no use for price transparency,” says Chris Barnes, senior vice-president for Europe at data vendor ClarusFT.

ClarusFT found 88% of all euro-denominated interest rate swaps traded in 2020 were deferred, mostly by four weeks.

And according to Esma’s consultation paper, on average, only 0.21% of bonds were deemed liquid in 2018.

A further problem that deferrals introduce is that they allow individual regulators too many options for setting their own requirements, which has led to many permutations of the rules.

For example, regulators can request aggregated details of a single day’s deferred trade information as early as the following day. Or they can require the aggregated publication of trades executed over the course of a week on the following Tuesday. They can decide prices of individual trades are to be published after two days and only the volume is masked by four weeks.

Users of the data have to decipher these different deferrals and cleanse the data accordingly.

“Deferrals make it difficult for users to understand the data quickly,” says Barnes. “Are you looking at a complete picture? Are you looking only at real-time data? It is exceptionally difficult to work with, as you have to work through all these combinations of deferrals, and that has to change.”

Everyone agrees Esma should unify the deferral regime by reducing the options that regulators have or by setting the regime for the whole of Europe with an opt-out for those regulators wanting more transparency.

But no-one agrees on what that unity should look like.

### European trim or US buzz cut

Esma puts forward three proposals that would each increase the number of bonds and derivatives subject to real-time transparency and simplify the regime.

All three proposals would scrap the SSTI deferral, and those benefitting from a deferral would have only their volume masked, which would then be published after a delay of two weeks.

“If you’re looking to simplify the regime, deleting SSTI is probably an easy one to cut back on, just because it doesn’t really apply to the vast majority of instances anyway,” says Steven Burrows, a senior associate at law firm Fieldfisher.

According to Esma’s analysis, only 4% of deferrals granted to non-equity trades in 2018 were due to SSTI.

This option would largely preserve the regime as it is today and wouldn’t institute much change.

“You have still got the issue of very generous deferrals with option one,” says Adam Jacobs-Dean, a managing director at hedge fund advocacy group the Alternative Investment Management Association (Aima).

Cutting the maximum deferral in half won’t significantly increase the number of use cases of post-trade data because two-week-old data is still too stale to be used for pricing. Dealers warn, however, it could threaten their ability to hedge illiquid instruments.

“Data published in real time can be used to see where a bond has been priced and [to] benchmark trades, but longer deferrals can only be used for valuation or reporting purposes,” says Stéphane Malrait, head of market structure and innovation at ING.

“I don’t think there is too much of an added benefit if you go from four weeks to two weeks, but there is a difference in terms of risk management because for some of those very illiquid bonds, two weeks may be too short [an] amount of time to hedge.”

The other two options would subject more instruments to real-time transparency by deleting SSTI and the deferral for liquidity. According to Esma’s analysis, this could subject far more trades to real-time transparency, as 94% of granted deferrals were due to illiquidity.

“I believe options two and three would deliver the most transparency in the sense that the liquidity deferral would be removed,” says a regulatory expert at a non-bank market-maker.

“If you look at other jurisdictions, like the US, there is no deferral based on liquidity, it is just based on size. We agree with getting rid of the liquidity deferral, and that’s why we prefer options two and three.”

These two options are similar to the way US transparency rules work, which require banks labelled as swap dealers or non-banks labelled as major swap participants to publicly disclose their executed over-the-counter derivatives through [swap data repositories](https://www.risk.net/commodities/5419061/giancarlo-undercuts-sdrs-push-for-dual-sided-reporting) (SDRs). The only deferral available is for swaps that are larger than a block size threshold, which receive a 15-minute deferral.

The two options would also shorten deferrals for trades classified as LIS. Option two would require the volume of a trade to be published after two weeks. Option three would create a two-tier LIS, with a regular LIS and a ‘super-LIS’, which would grant a longer deferral to trades much larger than the regular. Esma suggests possibly setting the super-LIS to five times larger than the regular. Trades that are above the regular but smaller than the super-LIS would only receive a two-day deferral. Trades larger than the super would then receive a deferral of four weeks.

The regulatory expert at the non-bank market-maker says it could be appropriate to set longer deferrals for super-LIS trades because of the particularly large size of the trades.

Advocates of revamping the deferral regime are gravitating toward options two and three. Barnes of ClarusFT says Esma and legislators should go further and completely mimic the US swaps transparency regime, as the success of their approach shows it hasn’t had a detrimental impact on dealers’ ability to hedge their trades.

“As long as the LIS is kept simple and similar to what happens in the US, which is effectively a single delay of 15 minutes, I think it is workable for a deferral regime,” says Barnes.

“If you look at SDR data, the impact of post-trade transparency is minimal. There are loads of trades that hit the tape within two or three minutes. If it was really vital that post-trade information was delayed, you wouldn’t see any trades in the SDR until the maximum 15 minutes. That just isn’t the case.”

One potential pitfall is that some European markets, such as Denmark, could become less transparent if they are all forced to adopt the same approach. They have already implemented [more transparent deferral regimes](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5825576/own-goal-mifid-ii-reduces-transparency-in-some-eu-markets) than any of the options offer.

Elizabeth Callaghan, a director at the International Capital Market Association, suggests allowing supervisors an option: “We do think any future harmonised deferral regime should be flexible enough, in rare cases, to allow country-specific niche exceptions whereby higher levels of transparency exposure is allowed, such as the Danish mortgage bond market.”

### Pass!

But banks don’t see the benefit in going for any of these options. They think Esma should first focus on making sure the existing framework is workable.

“Esma should make sure that post-trade transparency data can be usable in terms of quality, connectivity, access and readability,” says Malrait of ING.

“Once they know people will be able to use it, then they can assess if the calibration of deferrals makes sense to tweak.”

Matthew Coupe, a director of market structure at Barclays, says that, without achieving this first step, Esma cannot really determine what the true effects of today’s level of transparency will have on dealers’ ability to trade on their own risk.

As he and other bankers say, rather than changing the deferral regime, Esma and legislators should focus on setting up a consolidated tape for bonds. The benefit of a consolidated tape to investors is that it would provide prevailing market prices and volume quickly and make the current data usable without putting dealers in jeopardy.

“There are a lot of people who are beginning to use the data, but it’s not by any means something that’s been taken up as a whole by the market,” says Coupe.

“That’s generally because of the lack of a consolidated tape providing aggregated information and firms not being able to easily use the data. If people aren’t using it, we do not know what the impact of the current level of transparency is.”

Some buy-side firms also support this approach.

“We would prefer to keep the status quo for deferrals for the time being,” says Vincent Dessard, a senior regulatory policy adviser at the European Fund and Asset Management Association.

“It could come as a second step when a consolidated tape covering all financial instruments is smoothly running.”

However, proponents of publishing more information sooner say that deleting deferrals and shortening the deferral length would aid the usefulness of a consolidated tape as the entity disseminating the information would be able to show aggregated price information on more instruments.

“If they are going to invest all of that money in a consolidated tape and they want it to be of use to anyone, what they really should do is just implement Trace [Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine] in Europe,” says a regulatory expert at a venue, referring to the US bond transparency regime that publishes aggregated bond information.

### A different idea

If liquidity deferrals are to be recalibrated, different thresholds should apply to different classes of bonds, say banks. This approach was already discussed during the original calibration of Mifid II, as an alternative to setting the thresholds instrument by instrument.

Under the current regime, Esma classes a bond as liquid if the number of times it was traded over a quarter is higher than a set threshold, which is currently 15 trades a day, on 80% of the days, with an average size of more than €100,000 ($113,275). Assessments are done every quarter. The same threshold applies to all bonds.

Coupe says this doesn’t truly reflect how bonds trade, and so measuring the number of bonds – identified by unique codes, [International Securities Identification Numbers (Isins)](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5670106/isin-database-users-oppose-further-fee-increase) – is not an appropriate way to judge whether there is enough real-time transparency in the bond market.

“Bonds tend to trade a high portion on issuance and slow after that,” says Coupe. “Besides events in the bond’s lifecycle that might result in a spike in trading, you generally have a high proportion of Isins that don’t trade much. If the approach is to focus on the number of Isins that have been liquid, [is that] relevant to how the bond market functions? No, it’s not. Because, in practice, that’s not how the instruments operate.”

Bonds that are sparsely traded can suddenly become liquid following a major news event about the issuer, but then return to their illiquid state. These events could mean an [illiquid bond](https://www.risk.net/regulation/6783201/mifid-transparency-regime-snares-illiquid-bonds) is classed as liquid under Mifid II if a major trading event occurs in the preceding quarter of Esma’s assessment.

Malrait of ING says one way to resolve this issue would be to have different thresholds for determining liquidity based on the type of bond. Those deemed to be frequently liquid in Europe could have a lower threshold for determining liquidity, or more restrictive deferrals, than those deemed usually to be illiquid. This would somewhat mimic Trace.

The US regime allows for just a 15-minute deferral, only for large bond trades. The transparency regime as a whole only applies to dollar-denominated bonds on the basis that it is safe to assume these will be liquid.

The EU requires counterparties to report OTC bond trades if the bond is traded or listed on an EU trading venue, meaning swathes of non-EU bonds are also caught in the transparency regime. Limiting real-time transparency to bonds that are significantly traded in Europe would bring the EU closer to the US rules.

“If they do recalibrate liquidity deferrals in bonds, they should protect those very illiquid instruments and relax deferrals on the ones that are more liquid, where you don’t need to hold a position for four weeks for those instruments,” says Malrait.

“So maybe Esma should assess liquidity on a group level of type of instruments for bonds, rather than by Isin, as they do right now.”

### Unfinished transition

Esma’s assessment of the current Mifid II transparency regime may be premature – the final setting for deferrals hasn’t yet come into force.

Legislators decided to cautiously [phase in](https://www.risk.net/regulation/mifid/2456131/just-3-of-bonds-deemed-liquid-in-ecs-mifid-ii-phase-in-plan) the introduction of real-time bond transparency in four stages so that more bonds are classed as liquid with the advancement to each stage. Esma is still on the first stage.

Jason Waight, head of regulatory affairs and business management for Europe at MarketAxess, an electronic fixed income trading venue, says that, rather than changing the deferral regime, Esma and legislators should wait until the further stages of transparency have been phased in. That way, more bonds might become subject to real-time transparency, and firms wouldn’t have to jump through the hoops of updating reporting systems.

The next stage of bond transparency will lower the liquidity threshold to 10 times a day. To move onto this stage, Esma will need to revise level-two legislation and have it approved by EU legislators. In the consultation paper, it proposes doing just that.

“As a starting point, moving to stage two of bond liquidity assessments is helpful to build on the transparency that we have today,” says Jacobs-Dean of Aima.

According to analysis of post-trade data by Esma in the consultation paper, the second stage of bond transparency would have resulted in 55% more bonds being classed as liquid on average in all four assessments that took place in 2019 (see figure 1). Although this may sound like a significant increase, it isn’t. On average, a mere 0.4% of bonds would be deemed liquid in 2019 if Esma had used the stage two threshold.

“It’s still going to be less than 1% of bonds deemed liquid,” says the regulatory expert at the non-bank market-maker. “I find it hard to get too excited about this until they move to stage four.”

The latter stages promise more real-time transparency as the liquidity thresholds drop to seven in the third stage and two in the fourth stage.

The full transparency regime for derivatives has also yet to be implemented, as Esma is still using a ‘transitional’ transparency calculation to assess liquidity and size deferrals. The regulator was supposed to measure liquidity in derivatives in [April last year](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5821596/poor-mifid-data-could-condemn-otc-market-to-the-dark), but decided to postpone the test because of data quality concerns and uncertainty surrounding the UK’s exit from the EU.

### Brexit effect
The UK’s exit from the European Union could mar improvements to the transparency regime. The European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) would no longer include UK trading data in its assessment, so fewer bonds would be deemed liquid. It is currently temporarily including them.

The UK is now in a transition period, whereby it is not within the EU but agrees to abide by EU rules. That arrangement will end on December 31, unless EU and UK negotiators agree to extend it.

In its consultation paper, Esma provides some estimations as to how much of an impact excluding UK data from its liquidity calculations would have had for bond liquidity assessments taking place in 2019 (see figure 1).

Under a stage one scenario, where UK data was not included in assessments, on average, 60% fewer bonds would have been deemed liquid in 2019. Under a stage two scenario, where the UK leaves, there would have been 40% fewer bonds deemed liquid in 2019.

But sources caution that Esma’s assessment is imperfect, as it can’t take into account EU counterparties diverting their trades away from the UK to EU dealers and venues, which would add to the EU 27 volumes.

Esma was then due to carry out the assessment in April this year, but announced it was postponing again to avoid creating unintended operational risks for market participants already dealing with coronavirus issues.

Results of the test will now be published on July 15, and will take effect on September 15.

“All of the proposals to our mind could be made to work,” says Waight of MarketAxess.

“My view is that we’ve started, so let’s finish. I’m not persuaded that there is anything fundamentally wrong in what we’re doing. I think the calibration is, very sensibly, quite cautious.”
