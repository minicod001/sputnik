The clearing house for the London Metal Exchange (LME) would burn through all its prefunded default resources in a severe market crisis, a European Union-wide [stress test](https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma%E2%80%99s-third-eu-wide-ccp-stress-test-finds-system-resilient-shocks) of central counterparties shows.

Under a doomsday scenario set in March 2019 in which the CCP’s top two clearing members collapse, LME Clear would incur about €712 million ($808 million) of losses beyond the required initial margin of the defaulters, exceeding its €446 million of prefunded guaranty resources. The additional losses would have to be mopped up using further contributions from healthy clearing members.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) assessed 16 CCPs, subjecting each to a ‘Cover 2’ scenario, in which their two largest clearing members default, as well as two EU-wide stresses. The scenarios were applied to the participants’ balance sheets as of December 2018 and March 2019. Esma said its stress scenarios were similar in severity to the market moves witnessed over the height of the coronavirus-induced financial panic earlier this year – though for metals, the asset class of greatest importance to LME, the scenario was tougher.

LME Clear was the only CCP participant to incur a prefunded default resources shortfall under Esma’s scenarios. However, the CCP-specific scenarios would have consumed 81% of BME Clearing’s prefunded resources and 71% of OMIClear’s.

Under one of the two EU-wide scenarios, based on the collapse of the two clearing members that would consume the most prefunded default resources across all 16 participants, LME Clear was again the only CCP to exhaust its IM and guaranty fund, when using March 2019 data.

However, the prefunded resources of five other CCPs also took a hit under this scenario: Ice Clear Europe, Eurex, LCH Ltd, LCH SA and BME.

Absolute losses would be greatest for Ice Clear Europe – at €865 million, followed by Eurex with €595 million. These would consume 25% of Ice’s prefunded resources and 17% of Eurex’s.

As of end-March 2020, LME Clear had prefunded default resources, beyond initial margin, of $862 million, up from $472 million the year-ago quarter.

### What is it?
CCPs maintain default funds, often segregated by clearing service, to absorb losses in the event of a clearing member failure. They serve as a second line of defence to a clearing house after the defaulting member’s own initial and variation margin payments. The funds receive contributions from the clearing house and clearing members, and consist of prefunded and committed resources.

Esma has now conducted three EU-wide CCP stress tests. The latest round assessed firms’ credit and liquidity risks, as well as the impact of liquidation costs on concentrated positions.

### Why it matters
Risk mutualisation is the founding principle on which CCPs are built. A clearing house and its members both have ‘skin-in-the-game’ in the form of prefunded contributions to a collective default fund, which is supposed to ensure their incentives are aligned.

However, it’s the CCP’s job to size these contributions appropriately, which its attempts using internal stress tests and risk models. If a loss is incurred that wipes out these prefunded resources, members may gripe that the clearing house lowballed its risks, especially since they are the ones on the hook to make up for the shortfall.

Esma’s stress tests offer clearing members a fresh insight to the robustness of their CCPs’ default resources to use alongside the firms’ own metrics and disclosures. LME Clear may face additional scrutiny from stakeholders following its performance, as well as from the regulator. Esma said it would issue “necessary recommendations” to those firms “where the assessments expose[d] shortcomings in the[ir] resilience”.
