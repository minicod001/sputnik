Wells Fargo put aside $9.6 billion to cover bad loans over the three months to end-June, up from $3.8 billion in Q1.

Of this amount, around $8.4 billion was to bolster loss reserves, known as allowance for credit losses (ACL), and the remainder to write off delinquent obligations.

The proportion of loss reserves to outstanding loans was highest at the credit card portfolio, where ACL stood at 10.49%, up from 9.02% the prior quarter and 5.49% at end-2019.

Also in the consumer loan portfolio, ACL for senior lien family mortgages increased 26 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 0.55%, for junior lien mortgages 226bp to 2.7%, auto loans 32bp to 2.41% and other revolving credit loans 96bp to 4.79%.

In the commercial portfolio, commercial real estate mortgage ACL increased 124bp to 1.93%, for real estate construction 206bp to 2.23%, for commercial and industrial loans 128bp to 2.32% and for lease financing 305bp to 3.91%.

The supersized provisions taken in Q2 pushed Wells Fargo to a $2.4 billion net loss, compared to a $653 million net profit in Q1.

### What is it?  
Provisions for credit losses are taken out of income each quarter to cover expected shortfalls in payments from loans and other credit instruments.

### Why it matters
Not only do loan-loss provisions eat into income, they also sap a bank’s [capital.](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7548851/banks-push-for-capital-changes-as-cecl-provisions-soar) The billions put aside by Wells Fargo in Q1 and Q2 have put pressure on its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, which stood at 10.9% as of end-June, compared to 12% the year-ago quarter.

However, Wells Fargo is set for a period of capital accumulation, as [Federal Reserve rules](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7649206/three-us-banks-face-stress-capital-buffer-add-ons) have forced it to cut its dividend to $0.10 from $0.51 for the next quarter, and perhaps beyond. Though this is a blow to shareholders, it means the bank could make up some of the capital depletion caused by mounting loan-loss provisions.
