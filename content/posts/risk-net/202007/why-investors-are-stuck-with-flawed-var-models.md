{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Buy-side risk survey: VAR wasn’t much use in March, but it is ingrained in the industry_{{< /quote >}}

This is the third in a series of articles connected to our buy-side risk survey. Click [here](https://www.risk.net/topics/buy-side-risk-survey-2020) to read the rest of the series.

When Risk.net asked buy-siders which risk measure helped them most through the Covid-19 selloff, few chose value-at-risk.

Three-quarters of respondents to Risk.net’s buy-side risk management [survey](https://www.risk.net/media/download/1047451) use VAR to measure portfolio risk, behind only portfolio volatility (80%) and historical stress tests (77%). But asked how useful VAR had been during the selloff, one-third said “not very”.

“VAR is a suitable measure of risk 99% of the time – for the normal days. But risk management is about the 1%,” says Daniël Schotanus, a strategy specialist at Dutch quant fund Transtrend. “Traditional VAR methods don’t function properly for that reason.”

VAR estimates the maximum expected losses on 99 trading days – or 95 or 90, depending on the chosen confidence level – out of a hundred. But it says nothing about what happens in extreme conditions.

Critics say it leads to false confidence and excessive risk-taking in good times, and more brutal unwinds when conditions worsen. Its defenders say the measure – although imperfect – works as a signal of elevated risk and was never meant to do more.

The Covid selloff once again laid bare VAR’s limitations. Conventional VAR metrics said nothing about mounting risk in February, then went through the ceiling in March, says Schotanus.

When the S&P 500 peaked on February 19, the 99% one-day VAR of a portfolio invested in the index was around 2.5%, calculated using the historical method. By March 1, this had ticked up to 3%, data from Man Group shows. Then, the metric shot up to more than 6% over the next 10 days, when the coronavirus was already spreading rapidly.

On March 12, the S&P 500 lost 9.5%. It fell 12% on March 16.

Little wonder, then, that some investment managers see the measure as pointless. “We are required by regulation to look at value-at-risk for some of our strategies,” says Eoin Murray, head of investment at Federated Hermes. “But it’s not something we set a great deal of store [by], to be honest.”

Others go further, saying the measure can be dangerous in the wrong hands.

“A weak risk manager will hide behind VAR numbers,” says Tatjana Puhan, deputy chief investment officer at Tobam in Paris. “They’ll just say: ‘If the number is OK, then everything is fine – move on.’”

Blind faith in the model may lead investors to favour assets that see rare but oversize losses – and so look safer in the models than they truly are, says Transtrend’s Schotanus. It can also worsen systemic risk, triggering feedback loops and pushing investors to sell into falling markets.

But for all its failings, VAR is here to stay. It is widely used and deeply embedded in the regulatory framework. And some fund managers say it did do its job in March.

“During the selloff, VAR alerted us to the fact markets had got riskier,” says Christopher Reeve, director of risk at Aspect Capital in London.

Risk managers at the firm noticed one of its portfolios was adapting more slowly to market volatility than others. “That’s how the strategy was meant to be,” he tells Risk.net. “But it forced us to have the right conversations with the portfolio managers to make sure we were happy with the risk being taken.”

Mike Marshall, deputy fund manager at Invesco, says the Covid-19 crisis shows VAR is neither bad nor good – but it can be useful. “If all the parameters of your model stay the same, you can expect not to breach VAR a given number periods out of 100. That’s all. If you understand what VAR is saying based on your calculation of it, then it’s quite useful. If you misuse it, thinking you are safe because your VAR is low, you will likely suffer during periods of market turmoil.”

### Looking back with despair

This is not the first time VAR has been criticised. Nassim Nicholas Taleb – who popularised the idea of rare but calamitous ‘black swan’ events – has waged a campaign against it for years. After the global financial crisis, the measure was compared to an airbag that always fails in a crash.

Part of the problem with VAR stems from its reliance on backward-looking data, often over fairly short horizons, on volatility and correlations. Put simply, it assumes today is indicative of what will happen tomorrow.

As a result, VAR models have predicted low risk for years – right up to the eve of the coronavirus crisis. “You would need to go back to 2008 to see the levels of recent daily volatility,” says Invesco’s Marshall. Few managers look back that far. According to Risk.net’s [survey](https://www.risk.net/media/download/1047451), 39% of investors use a lookback period of one year or less, with only 18% going beyond 10 years. Even with longer lookbacks, episodes of past volatility would have been watered down by the benign conditions in recent years.

Quoniam Asset Management in Frankfurt saw its VAR balloon in March. “The numbers from before the coronavirus clearly did not anticipate the situation as this dynamic played out,” says Markus Ebner, who runs the firm’s multi-strategy portfolios.

These sorts of VAR spikes can hurt rather than help investors because they tend to occur precisely as a crisis takes hold, when liquidity disappears and the cost of exiting positions is highest.

“Traditional VAR methods make you active at the worst times,” says Joost Dijkers, Transtrend’s head of risk management.

On the other hand, if a manager decides they do need to trade out of positions as a crisis unfolds, the sudden jumps in VAR can slow them down. “It didn’t really allow the portfolio managers to change their portfolios as much,” says Nasreen Kasenally, chief risk officer at UBS Asset Management. “The risk team had to spend a lot of time thinking: ‘If that portfolio manager puts on this trade, will we still be within our VAR limits or not?’ If you need to do that type of analysis on several portfolios, it is a lot of work.”

VAR also tends to overestimate risk after bouts of high volatility. This leads managers to take smaller positions and makes it harder for them to recover any losses.

Transtrend’s Schotanus points to the 5.6% drop in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index on May 22, after China pushed forward with plans to pass its controversial national security law. It was the biggest one-day drop since 2015. A traditional VAR measure would then treat that as a ‘fairly normal’ move that is likely to be repeated. “When volatility spikes, [VAR] becomes temporarily a worse predictor of what to expect in extreme scenarios,” he says.

### Survival guide

Will the Covid selloff spell the end for VAR? Surprisingly, perhaps, it probably won’t.

The risk metric’s big advantage is its simplicity. “It does a job,” says Aspect’s Reeve. “It’s the least bad, single metric we can come up with that can work across different asset classes, that we can combine into one number.”

In an industry plagued by complexity, VAR is intuitive, widely applicable and easy to check. “If you see it, you have a feeling for what it does,” says Dijkers of Transtrend. “If you want to explain it to people that have something to say about an investment but aren’t going to grasp all the details, they’ll feel they understand it. It’s easy to apply to anything – a return stream, a market or a portfolio.”

It’s simple enough to tell whether a VAR model is working by looking at the number of breaches. That makes it attractive to both regulators and investors.

Dijkers says institutional investors have been imposing VAR limits in mandates. Recent events may even add to such requirements. Ebner says Quoniam is seeing more demand for its portfolio protection strategies, which adjust risk to stay within target VAR levels.

Under European rules, funds that trade exotic derivatives or engage in complex strategies must use VAR to calculate their exposures. Rules proposed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission last November would [set a VAR-based limit](https://www.risk.net/investing/7293506/sec-derivatives-rule-may-lead-to-new-products) on fund leverage.

In Risk.net’s [survey](https://www.risk.net/media/download/1047451), 10% of respondents said they planned to add VAR models to their toolkit, compared with 5% that planned to scrap them.

Everyone agrees, though, that VAR must be handled with care. “Like all models, value-at-risk has assumptions built into it,” says Reeve. “Those assumptions can be more valid or less valid depending on what the markets are in a portfolio and the type of portfolio.”

VAR fits Aspect’s strategies “pretty well” because the firm trades liquid instruments, he says: “The assumptions about normally distributed price returns and so on are relatively valid.” For other strategies, that wouldn’t necessarily hold.

“When you use value-at-risk, you need to think about the application,” says Tobam’s Puhan.

For alternative risk premia (ARP) strategies, for example – which harvest small gains over long periods, but suffer occasional but big drawdowns – expected shortfall is a better choice, she says. Quoniam uses expected shortfall to allocate risk budget across strategies in its ARP funds.

Risk.net’s [survey](https://www.risk.net/media/download/1047451) suggests most funds customise VAR to their needs. Methodologies that account for the tail of the distribution are more widely used than the simpler co-variance approach. Close to 40% of respondents use a 90% confidence level, and most of them calculate VAR over a one-day horizon – meaning breaches are expected once every two weeks. That suggests many firms use it as an early-warning system, rather than as a true measure of potential losses.

The range of lookback periods, from under one year to over 20, suggests fund managers are tailoring VAR models to their individual investment objectives.

Transtrend uses a proprietary risk measure that is less prone to wild swings, Schotanus says. At Quoniam, VAR models are constantly reviewed to see whether investments can be made.

At Federated Hermes, Murray sums up a common view: “We don’t think about risk in a single metric. At best, you can get close to understanding different elements of it. But it’s very difficult to get a single metric that gives you the entire picture.”

As Invesco’s Marshall concludes, the Covid selloff was a reminder of what VAR can and cannot do. Arguably, that is the lesson for risk managers to take from the episode. “We know what our VAR numbers tell us, and we use it accordingly,” he tells Risk.net.
