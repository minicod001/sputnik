Equity investors that can’t stomach the inflated cost of stock index puts are turning to the foreign exchange options market in search of a cheap hedge.

The question facing the bargain hunters is whether the bargain offsets can be relied on during the next equity meltdown – but FX markets have other advantages that are currently attracting interest.

“Relative to all other markets, FX is still somewhere you can get a large size done. If you have a big portfolio and you want a lot of protection, one of the cheapest places you can do that is in FX markets,” says James Athey, an investment director in the rates management team at Aberdeen Standard Investments.

Equity markets have staged a historic recovery since collapsing in March, but a 6% plunge in the S&P 500 on June 11 – apparently spurred by fears the US would be forced to slow or reverse its emergence from Covid-19 lockdown – suggested the recovery is not on strong ground. The problem for investors is that the surest hedge is also the most expensive.

According to data from UBS, out-of-the-money S&P puts were just over four times more expensive than their equivalent US dollar/yen puts, as of June 11. Euro Stoxx options were 4.7 times more expensive than euro/US dollar options, and Nikkei options were 3.38 times more expensive than their USD/JPY equivalents (see figure 1).

“When you compare the levels of FX volatility to the equity equivalents, FX vols are generally back towards their lowest quartile, or even in some case their lowest decile of their long-run distribution, whereas equity vols remain highly elevated,” says Adrian Boehler, global head of FX distribution at UBS.

Aberdeen’s Athey says the price differential is due in part to the growing long-S&P equity position of many funds since March. Investors tend to use equity index puts as a hedge, and the growing long cash position has meant put buying has risen in tandem. For example, an S&P put struck at 85% of the at-the-money point on February 3 was around 29 volatility points, compared with around 37 points on June 30.

On the FX side, traders say systematic sellers of volatility – who contributed to historically low options prices prior to March – have returned to the market sooner than expected. That has put downward pressure on FX volatility, making it cheap compared with equity options.

Athanasios Vamvakidis, global head of G10 FX strategy at Bank of America, says positioning in FX volatility is now about 20–30% longer compared with before the pandemic hit. But given concerns about the robustness of the stock market rally, it’s a trade that can still work, he argues.

“I think for investors it makes sense to buy some insurance, and given the strong correlation of FX with equities, currency vol might offer some opportunities,” says Vamvakidis.

### But is it a good hedge?

Of course, it’s important that the instruments are correlated. While the relationship between currency pairs and stock indexes can be weak during calmer times, correlations often rise in the event of a collapse in equities – a result of investors fleeing into safe havens, which tends to boost the US dollar and yen, for example.

USD/JPY correlations against the S&P hit 0.80, and 0.84 on the Nikkei in March, after being elevated for some time. Correlation for EUR/USD and the Euro Stoxx 50 jumped to -0.65, while for the AUD/USD and Australia’s AS51 it reached +0.77.

Correlations on all relationships bar the AUD/USD-AS51 moved toward zero quickly after March, but investors who use FX as a hedge are taking a view on how the currencies behave during equity stress, dealers argue – not their historical, rolling performance (see figure 2).

“If you believe correlations will return and the entry point is attractive from a relative valuation perspective – that is, that FX vol is currently cheap – then the rationale for putting hedges in place still holds,” says UBS’s Boehler.

Volatility on other pairs such as AUD/JPY and AUD/USD correlate well with the US index, and are also regularly cheaper than their equity equivalents (see figure 3).

“There is a big correlation during general risk-off events: stocks will go down, emerging markets currencies will sell off, USD/JPY will go down, so there are various trades that you can put on that may be cheaper than just downright buying the equity vol,” says Bob Diehl, head of FX derivatives trading at UniCredit.

Traders say equity-FX correlation is helped by the fact that there aren’t as many other factors that can interfere with the direction of exchange rates. One powerful force in currency markets – interest rate differentials – has weakened since central banks acted simultaneously to combat the Covid crisis. This means the main driver of FX movements during a selloff should be risk-on/risk-off sentiments – or so the argument goes.

Not everyone is convinced. Søren Grooss, chief portfolio manager at PKA, says the Danish pension fund manager looked at buying volatility swaps on EUR/USD as a hedge before March, where the payoff is the difference between a fixed strike and realised volatility, but decided against it as it would only have been attractive “if we saw a massive crisis”. To date, the trade would have a positive value but not a particularly large one, he says. In the end, the firm ran an open EUR/JPY exposure for some time as an equity hedge.

Grooss is sceptical of FX options as an equity hedge, noting that traditional safe-haven assumptions may not hold – in particular, it’s not a sure thing the US dollar will be the winner in the next risk-off event. Coronavirus infections have returned to rapid growth across much of the country.

### Vanilla options to dual digitals

The head of FX options at one US bank says non-typical options users have been putting on medium-term structural positions since March – and not just against equity holdings. Often, clients have used it as tail-risk protection for an existing portfolio of carry assets, he says – particularly credit, given liquidity in that asset class can evaporate in a severe shock.

He adds, though, that demand for FX options hedges since March has “actually not been as big as we would have anticipated”, as the market normalised faster than expected.

Some counterparties have stuck with vanilla options, while others have looked at more exotic structures such as multi-currency worst-of options, which base the payout on the worst-performing FX option pair in a given basket.

A cross-asset strategist at a second European dealer says the bank initially saw interest in plays on Euro Stoxx and EUR/USD. This was based in part on political discord over the issuance of collectively backed bonds to help raise funding for stricken EU member states. The plan was subsequently backed by France and Germany in mid-May.

The bank traded a number of so-called dual digitals, where the client pays 10% of the notional upfront and gets 100% if the stock index is below a barrier and the EUR/USD spot is below a barrier. The price at inception is based on implied correlation between the two rates, derived from options prices.
