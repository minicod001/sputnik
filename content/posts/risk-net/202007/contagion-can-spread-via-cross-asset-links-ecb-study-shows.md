{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Research throws more light on the hidden risks of central clearing_{{< /quote >}}

Financial stress can move between central counterparties, clearing members and their clients more widely than previously thought, recent research suggests.

A study by two European Central Bank (ECB) market infrastructure specialists uses network theory to build a picture of the complex latticework of links between derivatives clearing participants in the eurozone. The research echoes the findings of earlier work in showing a concentration of risk among a few members.

But it also reveals fresh insight, such as how the largest clearing clients can act as a conduit for contagion. Clearing members that are small but active across more than one asset class present a risk, too. The research was published in the [Journal of Network Theory in Finance](https://www.risk.net/journal-of-network-theory-in-finance/7411231/interdependencies-in-the-euro-area-derivatives-clearing-network-a-multilayer-network-approach) in February.

The findings may have implications for how regulators manage the risks of clearing and how CCPs set margin levels in light of the coronavirus pandemic. The volatility that engulfed markets during March and April has raised fears that CCPs were undercapitalised for such a stress event, and has led to renewed calls for a [margin floor](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7567431/higher-margins-would-aid-clearing-stability-ice-clear-chief) that would help insulate clearers during a crisis.

Lawmakers in Europe are already considering [changes](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7547651/european-lawmakers-urged-to-prevent-ccp-contagion-risk) to recovery and resolution rules to help prevent contagion spreading between CCPs.

With access to the vast dataset of derivatives trades reported under European regulation, Simonetta Rosati and Francesco Vacirca produced a multi-layer network model of the region’s markets. The study splits trading activity into six asset classes – rates, equity, foreign exchange, credit, commodity and other – with each asset class representing a single layer. Connections between participants, or nodes, have a weighting to indicate gross value of all transactions between two parties, in both directions.

Academics believe [multi-layer models](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/2451076/network-theory-takes-root-post-crisis-financial-markets) are a more realistic representation of the financial system than models in which different exposures are aggregated. Models with links that are arranged in layers reveal a more complex, three-dimensional network of connections than aggregate versions, with multiple routes for stress to spread from one counterparty to another.

Within the networks of CCPs, clearing members and clients in each layer, Rosati and Vacirca identified 58 “most significant” nodes – 17 CCPs and 41 clearing members. These 58 nodes accounted for 95% of all exposure across the network and at least 75% of each layer. This high degree of concentration isn’t surprising – several previous studies have highlighted that CCPs tend to be [dependent](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7379406/top-five-clearing-members-dominate-ccps) on a handful of clearing members for most of their business, and even that a [single highly leveraged member](https://www.risk.net/cutting-edge/banking/7324271/one-bad-apple-default-risk-at-ccps) could produce the majority of their default risk.

But the research found that some apparently unimportant clearing members turned out to be central, once the view changed from aggregate to multiplex. Although these members had few links to other nodes and relatively low exposures, they were present in several layers of the network and provided “a channel of contagion” allowing stress to spread from one asset class market to another.

Rosati and Vacirca’s model differs from previous research by including clearing clients in its model. In doing so, it reveals the systemic importance of some clearing members that provide clearing services to several large clients.

A 2017 study by the Financial Stability Board found [far faster spread](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5299766/twin-member-default-would-hit-up-to-23-ccps) of a crisis between CCPs once the model included credit and liquidity provision, custody services, and other infection routes as well as exposure through transactions. Even including only one additional transmission mechanism – through [asset price drops](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/6746796/fire-sales-turn-a-crash-into-a-crisis-simulation-shows) as well as contagious default – produced many more defaults and much more widespread damage to the financial system, another simulation found.

While the FSB model uses different routes of infection as layers, Rosati and Vacirca’s model is limited to transactions alone. Instead, its layers are different asset classes.

Rosati and Vacirca say the network’s dependence on members and CCPs outside the eurozone highlights the limits of regional systemic risk monitoring. Of the 17 CCPs in the “most significant” list, 10 are outside the eurozone. Of the 41 most significant clearing members, 13 are outside it. This underlines the ease with which problems could spread into the eurozone from outside its border, the authors point out.

Another [analysis](https://www.risk.net/journal-of-network-theory-in-finance/7411196/mapping-bank-securities-across-euro-area-sectors-comparing-funding-and-exposure-networks) of the eurozone banking system, by Anne-Caroline Hüser of the Bank of England and Christoffer Kok of the ECB, reached similar conclusions. Banks classified as globally systemically important, or G-Sibs, were highly interconnected in the equity, secured debt and unsecured debt markets. However, the research found, several non-G-Sib banks were also highly connected across all markets – and could therefore act as sources or transmitters of panic across multiple asset classes.

The study also found that different asset classes had radically different market structures in topological terms, underlining the importance of multi-layer rather than aggregate network analyses.
