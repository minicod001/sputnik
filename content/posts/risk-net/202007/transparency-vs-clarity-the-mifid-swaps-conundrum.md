Sometimes you just can’t do right for doing wrong – and regulators are no exception. As the European Securities and Markets Authority discovered when it tried to clarify Europe’s labyrinthine rules on transparency for over-the-counter derivatives transactions back in 2017. In launching an opinion document that attempted to disambiguate the rules for OTC trade transparency in the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, Esma succeeded only in clouding the picture further.

Now, more than three years on, as legislators and regulators [gear up](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7154086/why-europes-markets-might-need-mifid-iii) for a review of Mifid II, Esma is still seeking a solution to the transparency rules conundrum. And its answers could mean many more OTC trades get caught in their sights.

On March 10, Esma launched a consultation paper, proposing ways to improve Mifid II’s pre- and post-trade reporting rules. The crux of the issue is that OTC swaps and fixed income derivatives trades should be subject to transparency rules if they meet the TOTV definition – that is, if an equivalent instrument is listed or traded on a trading venue.

But opinions are divided about what belongs in this category. Many believe TOTV should capture more trades and that some revision of the criteria will be necessary. And while some hope not to expand the TOTV definition, still others say it should capture all OTC trades, as equivalent US rules do. Some of these schisms are along buy- and sell-side affiliations – but not all.

“There is a sense that the way the regime operates today means instruments that ideally should be in scope for post-trade transparency are not, and that hinges upon the way TOTV has been interpreted by Esma,” says Adam Jacobs-Dean, a managing director at hedge fund lobby group, the Alternative Investment Management Association. “There is definitely support on the buy side for an increase in the range of transactions that will be subject to post-trade transparency.”

And regardless of any individual firm’s stance on what does – or should – constitute TOTV, participants are at least hoping for greater clarity. In its 2017 opinion document, Esma set out the characteristics that market participants should examine to check whether a swap traded off-venue is the same as one being traded on-venue. It was trying to preclude [ambiguity](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5380406/confusion-plagues-start-of-mifid-swaps-reporting), or different interpretations of the level one text, which simply stated that instruments deemed to be TOTV had to be reported.

But Esma’s text did not specify how the rule should be applied to derivatives where two contracts with similar economics could have small legal or structural differences – and failed to clarify whether OTC swaps should be categorised as TOTV.

In its March market consultation, Esma has reviewed how swaps traded off-venue are assessed for meeting Mifid II’s transparency obligations and will produce its final report in September this year.

### Isin – or out?

One lightning rod for opinion is whether firms should base TOTV determinations on the unique [Isin](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5503226/isins-for-swaps-need-complete-rethink-say-platforms) codes (International Securities Identification Numbers), created by the Association of National Numbering Agencies’ Derivatives Service Bureau (Anna DSB), which are used to identify derivatives.

“There is a group of institutions which believes that the Isin itself is part of the TOTV determination process,” says Malavika Solanki, part of the Anna DSB management team. “There is another group of institutions which looks at the data attributes that define the Isin – without including the Isin in that process. That divergence of approach has been something that’s been pretty consistent for a couple of years now since the start of Mifid II.”

In Esma’s opinion, an off-venue swap is deemed to be TOTV if the set of reference data fields that trading venues and systematic internalisers use for reporting transactions to regulators match the characteristics of a swap traded on a trading venue. The Isin was included in that list.

The inclusion of the Isin severely limits the universe of reported derivatives, as the creation of an Isin is based on a more granular set of fields than Mifid II transparency rules. So, two derivatives that are similar could have a minor difference that results in different Isins, leading to an off-venue derivative being classed as a different instrument to its on-venue twin, and therefore exempt from reporting.

“Esma are not getting any data where an instrument has been classified as ‘not TOTV’ because it’s just completely exempt from pre- and post-trade transparency and transaction reporting,” says a regulatory expert at a large hedge fund. “They have no idea what trading activity is taking place in those instruments, which are a huge segment of the market, even on the interest rate derivatives side.”

Indeed, Esma reaches the same conclusion in its consultation paper: “The status quo results in exempting many OTC derivatives from the [Mifid II transparency requirements].”

In April 2019, Anna DSB published analysis that highlights the potential scarcity of OTC derivatives that get reported. It shows that significantly more Isins are being created than are appearing on Esma’s financial instruments reference database (Firds), which lists all instruments that are either listed or traded on Europe’s trading venues and systematic internalisers.

Firds is the closest there is to a golden source of which instruments are TOTV, and is used by many to inform whether their OTC derivatives are subject to the transparency regime. But the analysis shows only one in nine Isins generated for equity derivatives appears on the database and only a quarter of those created for foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are listed.

The significance of this finding is that if an Isin does not appear on Firds, it is possible the swaps that the Isins belong to aren’t being reported as part of Mifid II’s transparency regime either.

One venue source says this highlights the uneven application of the transparency requirements to OTC derivatives traded on- and off-venue and describes it as a “perverse outcome”. Mifid II is supposed to encourage more transparency and on-venue trading. But, because on-venue trades are automatically subject to the transparency regime, it could be encouraging firms to trade off-venue and avoid the requirements.

### The tweaks don’t work

Market participants want to see these problems fixed. As alternatives to the status quo, Esma put forward two possible solutions that would involve tweaking TOTV determinations – and one more radical solution.

One option would involve Esma redefining the required matching characteristics between off- and on-venue trades in determining TOTV. In the context of this option, Esma says it does not believe the Isin should be one of the determining characteristics – which would expand the scope of transparency requirements.

Esma also proposed reporting derivatives trades where the underlying instrument is TOTV. Known as u-TOTV, this option would draw far more equity derivatives into transparency requirements since equity underliers are listed.

But some sources doubt this would resolve the issue, as it would not significantly simplify the regime.

“I’m not sure I immediately see the benefit of redefining TOTV,” says Steven Burrows, a senior associate at law firm Fieldfisher. “If you’re going to change it, you should ideally change it to reduce the complexity. Option two just seems like everyone will have to update their systems to accommodate these new fields.”

There is also still potential for firms to create their own narrow interpretations of whatever fields Esma determines for TOTV, says the hedge fund regulatory expert:

“The only way of amending TOTV into some workable construct for OTC derivatives would be to remove this reliance on the specific reporting fields. To the extent you still try to match up individual reporting fields, there is going to be the potential for certain market participants to try to structure around whatever the standard is by filling in the fields in a slightly inconsistent manner.”

### The nuclear option

Option three offers the most radical change to the transparency requirements. It would do away with the term TOTV and subject all derivatives to transparency requirements.

This would align the European approach to that of the US, where banks labelled as swap dealers, and non-banks labelled as major swap participants, must report all their traded derivatives to swap data repositories.

“When Mifid II first came into force, there was a sort of struggle from firms as to how exactly you figure out whether something is TOTV or not,” says Fieldfisher’s Burrows. “From a simplicity standpoint, I can definitely see the appeal of saying everything is subject to transparency. But it sounds quite heavy-handed, as it would subject every OTC derivative to post-trade transparency and possibly pre-trade transparency.”

But the venue source says this option would help even up the disparities between off- and on-venue trading – and is not alone in this view.

“Esma should just get rid of this idea of TOTV for transparency purposes,” says Chris Barnes, senior vice-president for Europe at data vendor Clarus FT. “I’m not saying everything should be traded on-venue, but for transparency purposes you need a level playing field between on- and off-venue. Otherwise people who want to maintain information asymmetry will try to trade everything off-venue.”

But there are participants on both the buy side and sell side who object to the reporting obligation being expanded to such a degree.

Matthew Coupe, a director of market structure at Barclays, says it will make efforts to use the data currently published in the market even more difficult, because of the large volumes of transactions that will start appearing in datasets. He applies this criticism not only to the option of removing TOTV altogether, but also to the idea of u-TOTV.

“It’s just going to create even more complexity and confusion around data,” says Coupe. “If you look at the scope and the spread of the instruments that we have in Mifid and the challenges we have already, this would just be a step too far. The amount of data that is going to filter through is going to be huge and not really of much use.”

He proposes instead that Esma should not touch the transparency obligation for derivatives, but should focus instead on fixing Mifid II’s reported bond data, which suffers its own problems – and could be easier to fix.

“We should take a step-by-step approach,” says Coupe. “It takes a lot of time to work through these issues. So, let’s focus on transparency to get Mifid working quicker. Cash bonds should come first and then the derivatives piece.”

### Non-nuclear proliferation

A completely different approach would be to change the definition of systematic internalisers to avoid banks abandoning the label (see box: Systematic change). Buy-side firms don’t want an expansion of the term TOTV in case it means they have to create reporting infrastructures to report a small amount of derivatives trades. They currently have the obligation to report trades if they are facing another counterparty that is not a systematic internaliser and are classed as the seller in the transaction.

For derivatives – including those with interest rate, inflation index or equity and dividend underlyings – Mifid II defines the seller as the counterparty paying the floating or equity-linked rate and receiving the fixed rate. In the case of currencies, currency forwards and cross-currency swaps, the seller is defined as the counterparty that delivers the currency that comes first in alphabetical order.

Buy-side firms are able to avoid this obligation by transacting with systematic internalisers, which have to fulfil the reporting obligation.

Banks are categorised as systematic internalisers either by volunteering for the label, or if their off-venue trading in an instrument is higher than a regulatory threshold set by Esma. At the start of Mifid II, many banks [elected](https://www.risk.net/regulation/mifid/5331836/not-on-the-list-mifids-systematic-internaliser-mystery) to be systematic internalisers in all TOTV instruments in order to ease the reporting burden on their buy-side clients.

But banks may decide [not to elect themselves](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5979381/dealers-sour-on-mifids-systematic-internaliser-label) as such in future if their transparency obligations expand further. They could limit themselves to being systematic internalisers only in the instruments for which they breach Esma’s regulatory thresholds. Under this scenario, hedge funds could find themselves facing a dealer that is not a systematic internaliser and being classed as the seller in the transaction.

Regulators would therefore need to change the definition of systematic internaliser to avoid banks abandoning the label, in order to ease the adoption of wider post-trade transparency for the buy side (see box: Systematic change).

“The sell side have the capacity to report in much greater volumes than the buy side, and that is where the operational infrastructure really sits,” says Aima’s Jacobs-Dean. “Expanding TOTV may mean that buy-side firms will have to build reporting systems for a relatively small amount of volume.”

### Systematic change

Hedge funds want to see more derivatives data being put in the public domain. To achieve this, they say the systematic internaliser designation itself should be redesigned. Those captured by the definition should have the obligation to report all their derivatives trades in the sub-asset classes of derivatives in which they are found to meet the systematic internaliser definition.

“We thought very carefully about how you could achieve an increase in transparency while making sure it doesn’t become an additional reporting burden to the buy side,” says Aima’s Jacobs-Dean. “Rather than necessarily amending TOTV itself, you could say any OTC derivatives transaction involving a firm that is a systematic internaliser in the relevant sub-asset class would be subject to post-trade transparency.”

This approach would require further changes to the way systematic internalisers are determined, as Mifid II currently confers the label on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Banks could narrow the scope of the transparency obligation by limiting the number of instruments in which they meet the criterion. The hedge fund regulatory expert says one way to solve this would be to set systematic internaliser status to sub-asset class levels that have been set out in level two text – regulatory technical standard 2 (RTS 2) – which specifies thresholds for illiquidity and size deferrals as well as waivers from pre- and post-trade transparency requirements.

The RTS 2 text groups derivatives by type, and includes all maturities and tenors within the definition of that sub-asset class. For example, swaptions, fixed-to-floating cross-currency swaps, floating-to-floating cross-currency swaps and fixed-to-floating single currency swaps are all categorised as separate sub-asset classes of interest rate derivatives.

“Esma would have to set systematic internaliser status on the sub-asset class under RTS 2,” says the hedge fund regulatory expert. “To the extent we went down the approach of requiring all systematic internalisers’ derivatives trades to be reported, regulators would have to be clear on [their] designating themselves on a sub-asset class level.”
