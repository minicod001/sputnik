European lenders with mixed portfolios would see their risk-based capital ratios fall furthest under a prolonged pandemic-induced recession, a new stress test by the [European Central Bank](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ssm.pr200728_annex~d36d893ca2.en.pdf?731039993a2a10392e3b7679d1669fb5) (ECB) shows.

Out of the 86 banks subjected to a [severe Covid-19 scenario](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7660071/severe-covid-recession-could-topple-some-eu-banks), 31 classified as ‘diversified lenders’ would see their weighted average Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio drop 7 percentage points over the three-year test horizon. This compares to an overall average of 5.4pp.

The 17 defined as ‘corporate, wholesale and sectoral lenders’ are also estimated to suffer more than average, with a 6.4pp capital depletion projected through the severe scenario.

In contrast, the 20 ‘global systemically important banks (G-Sibs) and universal lenders’ are expected to get off lightest, with an average capital depletion of 5.4pp.

As of end-2019, banks classified by the ECB as ‘diversified lenders’ had an average CET1 ratio of [14.3%](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/ecb/pub/pdf/ssm.supervisorybankingstatistics_fourth_quarter_2019_202004~4848fcfef2.en.pdf), ‘corporate, wholesale and sectoral lenders’ 15.6%, and G-Sibs 13.6%. Across the 86 banks subjected to the tests, the end-2019 ratio was 14.5%.

The makeup of portfolios held by ‘diversified lenders’ and ‘corporate, wholesale and sectoral lenders’ goes some way to explaining why they would be hardest hit from the worst-case scenario.

Supervisory data from Q4 2019 shows that both types of bank had large chunks of their loan books allocated to non-financial corporations – exposures projected to incur 45% of total credit impairments under the severe Covid-19 scenario.

‘Diversified lenders’ are also highly exposed to household loans. Consumer credit and mortgage assets are projected to make up 36% and 14% of total impairments under the severe scenario, respectively.

The poor profitability of these banks may also be a factor in their below-average performance. As of end-2019, ‘corporate, wholesale and sectoral lenders’ had a return on equity (ROE) of 3.6% and ‘diversified lenders’ 3.9%. G-Sibs, in contrast, boasted an ROE of 5.3%.

The ECB said that banks with higher profitability saw lower levels of capital depletion under the severe scenario.

### What is it?

The ECB conducted a vulnerability analysis on 86 significant institutions overseen by the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) between April and July, to gauge the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their capital positions.

The European Banking Authority’s stress testing methodology was used as the basis for the analysis, including the assumption that bank balance sheets stay static over the three-year scenario time horizon.

Individual banks’ results will inform the upcoming round of Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process [(SREP)](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/banking/srep/srep_2019/html/index.en.html) analysis.

### Why it matters

A prolonged recession, the EU’s second in a decade, could sound the death knell for certain bank business models. ‘Diversified lenders’ may have mixed portfolios, but unlike the G-Sibs, they lack the supersized trading desks and roster of asset management clients that can bring in revenues even in the midst of an economic downturn.

This in part explains why their profitability has been lagging in recent years. Increased competition from overseas banks, especially from the US, hasn’t helped, either.

Absent a rapid economic turnaround, or further regulatory relief, a number of these middle-of-the-road lenders could see their CET1 ratios drop to dangerous levels. To avoid regulatory sanction, they may have to sell assets and deleverage, possibly under pressure, which could transmit price shocks throughout the banking system.

Alternatively, a number may take the opportunity to merge with one-time rivals, drawing on the strength of their combined equity to ride out the recession.
