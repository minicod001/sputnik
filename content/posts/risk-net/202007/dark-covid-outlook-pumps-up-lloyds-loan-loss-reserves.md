UK lender Lloyds took a £2.4 billion ($3.1 billion) charge for expected credit losses (ECL) on souring loans in Q2, pushing its overall stock of loan-loss reserves to £7.2 billion, close to double its amount at end-2019.

The firm said an update to the macroeconomic scenarios it uses to gauge future impairments drove the ECL build. This contributed £1.8 billion to provisions in Q2, and £2.6 billion over the first six months of the year. Charges related to exposures that were undergoing restructuring but have since been hit by the coronavirus crisis totalled £432 million over the first half.

The firm’s new base case forward-looking scenario, used to generate its ECLs, now projects GDP will decline 10% in 2020, compared to the 5% decline estimated back in Q1. Unemployment is also expected to hit 7.2% in 2020, compared to 5.9% in the Q1 version. ECLs are estimated by blending the outputs of several scenarios, with the base case, upside case and downside case receiving a 30% weighting each, and the severe downside scenario 10%.

By end-2020, the bank projects ECL reserves will have increased between £4.5 and £5.5 billion. The upper bound is the equivalent of 32% of 2019 net income, and 74% of the bank’s earnings over the first six month of 2020.

### What is it?

Under IFRS 9, banks’ ECL provisions are calculated using forward-looking scenarios for GDP growth, unemployment, inflation and short-term interest rates, among other economic indicators.

Each scenario uses assumptions that are set using a standardised framework, supplemented with the independent judgement of the bank’s managers. A central or baseline scenario, reflecting the most likely path the economy will take, is assigned a high probability of occurring and therefore has the most influence over the size of ECL provisions. Less probable, but more extreme scenarios have a lesser role in shaping overall provisions.

### Why it matters

Lloyds has become more bearish about the future of a UK economy ravaged by the coronavirus crisis. Official figures show UK GDP fell roughly 20% in April alone, and the Q2 decline is pegged at around -25%. This likely explains why the bank revised its scenarios in Q2.

While the ECL hit to income was substantial, Lloyds’ capital ratio benefited from regulatory relief that also applied to [Barclays](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7660621/relief-for-credit-losses-buoys-barclays-capital-ratio) and other European peers, which prevented this provision build affecting its core solvency measure. This helped push its CET1 ratio to 14.6% at end-June, compared to 14.2% at end-March.

This means Lloyds will likely avoid regulatory censure this year over the state of its solvency ratio. Whether investors will demonstrate similar forbearance remains to be seen.
