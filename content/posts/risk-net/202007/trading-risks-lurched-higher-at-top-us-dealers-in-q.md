Top US banks’ trading loss estimates surged over the three months to end-June.

Average trading value-at-risk more than doubled quarter-on-quarter at [JP Morgan](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7655021/var-doubles-at-jp-morgan-in-q2), to $128 million.

Goldman Sachs’ VAR climbed 51% to $122 million in Q2, and Morgan Stanley’s 50% to $60 million.

Bank of America’s also spiked, to $81 million – up 69% on the prior quarter.

BofA calibrates its management VAR to a 99% confidence interval, whereas JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley use a 95% level. However, BofA did provide pro forma figures at the 95% level, which for Q2 totalled $21 million, down 22% on the Q1 amount.

### What is it?
Value-at-risk measures the potential loss due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon to a specified confidence level.

The VAR output used for internal management purposes differs by bank. At JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, models calibrated to a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period are used. In contrast, Bank of America uses a 99% confidence interval and a one-day holding period, though it also discloses outputs calibrated to a 95% confidence level, too.

Because each bank sets the parameters and sensitivities of its VAR model differently, and use their own historical data as inputs, VAR model outputs are not comparable between firms.

### Why it matters
Whipsawing markets and frantic client activity in part explains the leap in risk levels at the top US dealers. Morgan Stanley, for instance, posted revenues of $5.6 billion for its trading arm in Q2, up 68% from a year ago. Cross-town rival Goldman Sachs generated $7.2 billion of net revenues from trading, a whopping 93% more than a year prior.

But changes to the VAR models themselves also affected last quarter’s outputs. [BofA](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/d70d6be8-5738-443c-8db7-6fbbb0d6e51b) said the quarter-on-quarter surge in its VAR was “driven by the inclusion of market volatility stemming from the COVID-19 crisis in the look back period”. By factoring in the extreme market moves witnessed in March to its historical data, the bank’s VAR model would be expected to spit out higher loss estimates than before. This also explains why VAR shot up even though the size of its trading portfolio was flat quarter-on-quarter, at $485 billion.

The influence of the recent bout of volatility on market risk models will vary from bank to bank, though, as some firms give more weight to recent data than others. Those firms taking a more conservative approach may take fewer big trading risks in the coming quarters than their more aggressive peers.
