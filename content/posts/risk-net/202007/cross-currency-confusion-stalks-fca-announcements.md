The potential for Libor benchmarks to be discontinued at different times is leading to valuation uncertainty in the cross-currency swap market, say dealers.

When an announcement is made to signal the end of a Libor rate – which could be as early as this year – the rate to which outstanding Libor-linked contracts will fall back to is set. But participants are concerned that any announcement might not cover all 35 Libor currencies and tenors at once.

These could instead be staggered throughout the coming year – meaning the opposing legs of a cross-currency swap could be fixed up to a year apart – and the resulting gaps could create major uncertainty for valuations.

“It creates a lot of confusion,” says Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy at Bank of America (BofA). “It naturally leads to questions like: why would that be the case? And does the particular fallback period for one currency create winners or losers versus another currency?”

[Fallback rates](https://www.isda.org/2020/05/11/benchmark-reform-and-transition-from-libor/) consist of the designated risk-free rate (RFR), such as the US secured overnight financing rate, plus a spread to account for the credit risk element of Libor. The spread is based on the five-year median of the difference between the relevant Libor benchmark and a comparable, compounded version of the RFR.

Fallbacks are designed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and its members and published by Bloomberg. These fallbacks began publishing on July 17 and will be fixed once the UK Financial Conduct Authority or Ice Benchmark Administration makes a discontinuation announcement for each legacy rate.

Broadly speaking, the five-year calculation window uses the announcement date as its endpoint, so different announcement dates for each currency would mean different calculation periods for each leg of a cross-currency swap.

“The cross-currency swap market is the clearest example of one where the fallback spreads for one leg might be known with absolute certainty, but the other leg is not. That can lead to some problems,” says Joshua Younger, head of US interest rate derivatives strategy at JP Morgan.

According to BofA research, the timing of the calculation window can be significant. One example cited is the estimated three-month Libor-SOFR spread. If set using a five-year window ending at the end of this year, it could be 26.1 basis points, according to BofA. But if set at the end of 2021, for instance, which takes in a longer period of pandemic-driven low rates, it could be as much as 3bp lower.

Fallback spreads have already been on the move, according to Bloomberg data. For example, the three-month Libor-SOFR spread has shifted from 24bp to 26bp since the beginning of the year. During the same period the Libor-Sonia spread has seesawed, starting the year at 12bp before dropping to 11.5bp on March 20, then climbing back up above 12bp.

Given the calculation window for each Libor currency is unknown, this means valuations are difficult as it’s hard to know who the winners and losers on the trade will be. However, JP Morgan’s Younger believes this is just a risk that the market will have to run.

“The range of outcomes for all these things is a handful of basis points, and that does matter to some people,” he says. “But the vast majority of end-users will be somewhat unfazed. At the end of the day, it’s just a risk that people will manage and can be hedged.”

### Quick change

Until June, the market was expecting discontinuation announcements to arrive towards the end of 2021. But the FCA’s head of markets policy, Edwin Schooling Latter, told the audience of a [Risk.net webinar](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7566041/libor-death-notice-could-be-served-this-year-fca) on June 22 that they could come as early as November or December of this year.

Further information about which specific settings will be sent packing this year could come as early as September, following [market consultations](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7654971/consultation-on-libor-cessation-expected-in-september) conducted by Ice Benchmark Administration – the Libor administrator.

Cross-currency swaps have [$26.3 trillion](https://stats.bis.org/statx/srs/table/d6) in notional outstanding, according to data published by the Bank for International Settlements, with roughly half executed by banks. The data shows the US dollar is a leg in 87% of cross-currency swaps.

The cross-currency swap market has slowly been adopting the new risk-free rates and has seen several firsts in the past year. In November, the first [all-RFR cross-currency swap](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7205276/first-all-rfr-cross-currency-swap-traded) was traded using SOFR and €STR – the new euro short-term rate – as the benchmarks for the two legs. A month later, the [first Ibor-RFR swap](https://www.risk.net/investing/derivatives/7275071/first-ibor-versus-sofr-cross-currency-swap-trades) was traded, using SOFR and Australia’s bank bill swap rate. In April, Crédit Agricole and Bank of China executed the first [USD/CNY swap using SOFR](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7534996/banks-trade-first-usdcny-cross-currency-swap-versus-sofr).

Given that cross-currency swaps are bilateral derivatives, counterparties must agree to adopt the Isda protocol in order for the trades to be subject to its pre-cessation triggers, which move contracts onto fallback rates even if Libor is still alive. One of the triggers is tied to an announcement from regulators on benchmark discontinuation. Isda’s protocol is set to be published this month and adopted by November, depending on the timing of a [green light from competition authorities](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7650891/antitrust-fears-cloud-isda-protocol-and-fallback-spreads).

If not all counterparties adopt the protocol, upon an announcement some swaps would move to fallback rates but not others – a situation dealers are keen to avoid.

“For the benefit of RFR cross-currency swap liquidity and market functioning, having synchronised pre-cessation triggers is the optimal end-result,” says Richard Chambers, global co-head of short-term macro trading at Goldman Sachs.
