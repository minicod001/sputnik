Clearing deliverable foreign exchange swaps and forwards could slash leverage ratio exposures by up to 90% under new counterparty credit risk rules compared with bilateral trades, giving some dealers a capital incentive to clear the positions that would outweigh the cost of posting margin for the first time.

“I think this could be a game-changer for the future of clearing and we do believe there is a benefit for the leverage ratio in using clearing houses,” says a collateral head at one European dealer.

“It’s not quite clear in terms of amount but we are looking at this very intensively, to make sure that we will be ready in case of a large impact with the new leverage ratio computation methodology.”

Counterparty credit risk exposures calculated under the existing counterparty credit risk methodology, the current exposure method (CEM), feed into many parts of the capital framework, including the leverage ratio. Under the CEM, cleared trades do not get special treatment and it does not recognise the netting benefits that come from facing a single counterparty.

With FX swaps and forwards currently exempt from having to post variation and initial margin, and cleared trades requiring both, dealer interest in clearing the products has been muted.

But the new method to replace the CEM, the standardised approach to counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), is a more risk-sensitive methodology than its predecessor. While it increases exposures for some positions, it gives big savings to cleared positions, and provides significant netting benefits. This means the capital savings from clearing of FX swaps and forwards could for the first time outweigh the costs of posting margin.

“People in the market are definitely talking about it. And while with FX swaps the costs of clearing often exceeds the benefits, the regulatory capital drivers are definitely in place and I’m sure more and more people will be looking at it,” says the head of FX at a second large dealer.

### Change is coming

The CEM has long been criticised for being insensitive to risk. Dating back to the publication of the first Basel Capital Accord in 1988, the CEM works by adding the current exposure – the greater of the sum of the current mark-to-market values or zero – to the potential future exposure (PFE).

The problem lies in the calculation of potential future exposure, as a bank is prevented from netting more than 60% of its portfolio. The remaining gross exposure has to be multiplied by a number based on its residual maturity and instrument type. Banks argue this vastly overstates the true risk.

When it was introduced in 2015, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (BCBS) leverage ratio used the CEM’s methodology to calculate the derivatives exposure numbers, [creating headaches](https://www.risk.net/regulation/basel-committee/2297737/leverage-rumpus-banks-protest-impact-ratio-revisions) for dealers’ high notional derivatives books. And given it did not recognise the effects of collateralisation and limited netting benefits, it made little sense to dealers to clear relatively short-dated products like FX swaps and forwards that didn’t require margining outside a clearing house environment.

Currently, deliverable FX swaps and forwards can be cleared at LCH’s ForexClear service and at Eurex. At LCH, volumes in its deliverable FX options, forwards, spot products, which have ten live members, have been flat since 2019.

But with the SA-CCR set to replace the CEM in the leverage ratio, that may soon change. The SA-CCR was finalised by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2014, and the body approved it for use in the leverage ratio at the end of 2017.

In the US, the Federal Reserve has already given banks permission to use the SA-CCR well before the January 1, 2022 mandatory start date. In Europe, by contrast, SA-CCR won’t be used to calculate banks’ leverage ratio until an update to the EU’s banking laws, known as the Second Capital Requirements Regulation, takes effect in June 2021.

Simply speaking, the calculation sees a regulatory-defined so-called alpha measure, set at 1.4, multiplied by the sum of the replacement cost and PFE.

The first major benefit comes from a reduction in the margin period of risk (MPOR), which is one element of the so-called maturity factor input, which in turn helps determines the PFE. The MPOR estimates the period that might be required for a firm to rehedge itself following the default of a counterparty. The higher the MPOR, the higher the overall PFE.

For non-cleared transactions subject to daily margin agreements, the MPOR is floored at 10 business days, but it can increase to up to 20 days for bilateral netting sets consisting of any illiquid trades or more than 5,000 transactions. The MPOR for all cleared trades is set at 10 days.

“The lower margin period of risk is really designed to reflect the stronger CCP frameworks and the rulebook around default management processes,” says Kahyang Chong, head of ForexClear product for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at LCH.

According to LCH, this MPOR difference results in a 30% reduction in exposure compared to the same trade kept on a bilateral basis.

A second saving in SA-CCR comes from clearing houses’ use of a settled-to-market model. Under the current CEM framework, PFE is based on the maturity of a trade. Banks wishing to reduce the maturity of a trade to cut PFE can choose to adopt STM, which treats daily variation margin posted to CCPs as settlement of the trade. Clearing houses began offering STM to users [in 2017](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5374761/lch-and-eurex-extend-new-swap-vm-treatment).

In a [frequently asked questions document](https://www.bis.org/basel_framework/chapter/CRE/52.htm?tldate=20191231&inforce=20191215&export=pdf) that became effective on December 15 last year, the BCBS confirmed that trades that use STM treatment are treated as unmargined.

Under SA-CCR, unmargined trades do not include a 1.5x multiplier that applies to the maturity factor for margined trades. According to LCH, this can generate an extra 20% reduction in exposure compared to bilateral trades, taking total savings up to 50%.

“Based on the SA-CCR framework, a 50% reduction is the maximum amount of savings banks can achieve on a single trade done through clearing rather than bilaterally, which will feed into the leverage ratio calculations. The savings that can be achieved by clearing under SA-CCR are driven by a lower MPOR and STM collateral classification,” says LCH’s Chong.

A third saving on exposure can be had through the SA-CCR’s greater use of netting when calculating the replacement cost input. By facing a CCP instead of multiple counterparties, dealers can offset their positions and – for non-directional portfolios at least – reduce their exposures.

“It makes sense to argue that the more trades you can get into a single netting set, the better, or more effective the level of risk offset is likely to be, and clearing is one way to achieve this,” says Luke Brereton, co-head of prime services at Standard Chartered.

“If my portfolio is spread across 10 dealers, then I have at least 10 netting sets and the level of netting is not going to be as great as if I have 10 dealers and one netting set through the clearing house.”

LCH’s calculations estimate that banks could see savings of between 20% and 40% in exposure for FX swaps and forwards, compared with keeping them bilateral. All together, Chong says that clearing FX swaps and forwards under SA-CCR could cut exposures by up to 90%.

SA-CCR isn’t kind to all types of derivatives trades though. According to the latest [Basel III monitoring report](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d500.pdf), large and internationally active firms – including the G-Sibs – are estimated to see their CCR charges increase 26.7% on average relative to current levels under fully-loaded SA-CCR rules.

Facing a big overall jump in exposures, and therefore leverage ratio requirements, dealers may want to jump at clearing FX products as a way to offset that rise.

“If by clearing more products banks can generate some leverage ratio relief, then definitely they will be keen to do it,” says the collateral head at the European bank.

SA-CCR is on balance [more beneficial](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5307456/repeal-cem-reform-sa-ccr) for futures commission merchants as well, which could entice more firms to offer the service for FX products, increasing competition and lowering fees for clients.

“We see SA-CCR as something that is also imperfect, but by and large the transition to it is something that works very well for the cleaning business because you go from that pure notional-based approach to a more thoughtful risk-based approach. And when you layer that on top of the clearing paradigm you could see additional market entrants come into the fold,” says the head of FX prime brokerage at a US bank.

### Not so fast 

However, these calculations are portfolio dependent and the final amount of savings could swing significantly one way or the other. Parameters such as the number of counterparties faced at any given time, how a position is split between them and how directional is the portfolio, all play a role.

“I think these calculations could be gamed a little bit. In the best-case scenario, you have a well-balanced portfolio which responds favourably to SA-CCR and looks really nice compared to CEM,” says the FXPB head. “Where you get into issues with SA-CCR is on those long-dated directional FX portfolios, that oftentimes CEM has a better output for.”

Others point out that the leverage ratio is only one aspect of the capital framework and is not the binding constraint for many firms.

“A bank like Standard Chartered tends not to be leverage ratio-constrained today and so although it's an important aspect to make sure that our business is operating efficiently, it will not be the sole driver,” says Standard Chartered’s Brereton.
