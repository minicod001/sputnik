This is the second in a series of articles connected to our buy-side risk survey. [Click here](https://www.risk.net/topics/buy-side-risk-survey-2020) to read the rest of the series.

Sudi Mariappa, head of portfolio risk management at Pimco, has a degree in chemical engineering – training that he says has taught him to iterate until he finds a solution, rather than look for absolutes. Likewise, the lessons he has drawn from the Covid-19 crisis will lead to a “sharpening” of Pimco’s existing risk management tools, rather than an overhaul.

One example is the toolkit used by the fixed income giant to manage liquidity risk. It includes running stress tests, maintaining liquidity buffers, identifying concentrations and regularly reviewing all of the above.

As across the industry, the market selloff in March translated into liquidity pressure for Pimco, emanating both from its assets and liabilities.

“What surprised us really was what happened to higher-quality assets and, in particular, short-dated corporates. The system had a liquidity issue: some two-year investment-grade bonds traded down 10–15% in a period of days – that’s the type of dislocation you got,” says Mariappa.

At the same time, a net €43 billion ($49 billion) was pulled out by Pimco’s investors in the first quarter, according to results posted by its parent Allianz.

Despite this, Mariappa says the firm was not “forced to do anything on liquidity” – such as, for example, selling assets to meet margin calls.

“Going into it, we knew that liquidity is a key component because it allows us flexibility and the valuations were fairly tight. The crisis demonstrated the importance of managing liquidity throughout,” he tells Risk.net.

While no major changes were necessary, the firm did iterate on its approach, making tweaks as the crisis unfolded. Liquidity buffers got padded, risk meetings became an everyday occurrence and derivatives were used more extensively to maintain exposure to some benchmarks.

For example, one set of liquidity stress tests Pimco uses is based on historical data. “We look at a five-day window within the worst period – trailing five days – and say: ‘What were the redemptions? What was the cash liquidity need?’” says Mariappa.

But during the Covid-19 crisis, Pimco increased its liquidity buffers by expanding that window beyond five days, he notes: “We did that more for the strategies and asset classes that were more volatile, such as credit, high-yield and emerging markets.”

Another change was the frequency of meetings between the risk team and Pimco’s chief investment officers (CIOs): it went from three to four times a week to daily, meaning more frequent reviews of liquidity and other risks, Mariappa says.

“We would update the CIOs on cash redemptions or inflows, market moves, transactions, any performance that was either positive or negative that was unexpected. And we did that pretty much for about three weeks.”

After the initial crisis passed, attention turned to its more lasting effects. Mariappa recalls his father – also an engineer – telling him: “At some point, what’ll happen is you’ll hit an inflection point and you have to be really careful because if you keep iterating you’ll be going down a cliff.”

One of the biggest shifts, in Mariappa’s view, is that idiosyncratic risks within specific sectors and companies have eclipsed macro concerns.

“When people talk about the equity rally, they talk about a rally just in a few names. I’ll take the flip of that and say: when I look at defaults or when I look at sharp moves right now in the corporate market, it’s happening in single names,” he says.

As defaults rise, recovery rates in some sectors could be [in the low single digits](https://www.risk.net/investing/derivatives/7563341/recent-defaults-lead-to-record-credit-derivatives-payouts). “What you’ll see now is what I call the aftershocks might be more on a security or idiosyncratic risk level,” says Mariappa. In some ways, the current situation reminds him of bankruptcies in the 1980s, “when a lot of retailers’ and airlines’ recovery values were less than a few cents”.

Investors got a taste of this in June, when the credit default swap auction for JC Penney valued the company’s bonds at 0.125 cents on the dollar. “That was really shocking to a lot of people, because their recovery value people thought was like 20 cents,” he says.

Pimco is also paying greater attention to risks in specific sectors, such as energy. According to the latest [report](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-us-leveraged-loan-default-insight-ttm-institutional-loan-default-rate-tops-4-highest-since-may-2010-22-07-2020) from Fitch Ratings on US leveraged loan defaults, the overall corporate default rate has topped 4% on the trailing-12-month measure, whereas in the energy sector it is more than 15%.

“Sector concentration or single-name concentration may be a bigger risk going forward,” says Mariappa.

### Shock therapy

Mariappa says the crisis will not fundamentally alter the way Pimco manages risk. Any changes will be more evolutionary than revolutionary.

This has long been the case with Pimco. The firm manages $1.9 trillion across roughly 2,000 funds and separate accounts. Most of these track a benchmark, although some are unconstrained.

Given the size and scale of Pimco’s operations, “we have certain things that we have to follow”, says Mariappa: “But we have always evolved. The markets evolve. Different risks evolve. We’ve got to constantly evolve. It’s a dynamic process.”

He expects most in the industry will take a similar view.

Two-thirds of respondents to Risk.net’s buy-side risk management [survey](https://www.risk.net/investing/7658331/before-and-after-the-covid-19-storm-buy-side-risk-survey) said they were planning to make changes to their risk management practices as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. At most firms, these changes will likely take the form of tweaks, rather than major overhauls. For instance, 71% said the content of their risk reports would change, while 45% planned to reduce risk limits.

Most respondents had no plans to scrap existing risk models, despite expressing deep dissatisfaction with some of them. One-third of respondents said value-at-risk was not useful in helping their firms navigate the selloff in March. However, only 5% intend to scrap VAR models, while 10% are planning to add more of them.

Mariappa thinks that is the right approach. While some approaches were more useful than others, they all had something to offer during the market turmoil. There are therefore no plans to do away with mainstays such as VAR.

“Especially during periods of stress, there’s not one number or framework or one checklist that works,” says Mariappa. He uses the metaphor of flying a plane. In normal conditions, the plane is on autopilot and there may be only one measurement that matters.

“When you hit a period of turbulence, it’s not just [one thing]. It’s not just volatility,” he says. “Value-at-risk, volatility, concentrations – they’re all pieces of the puzzle, and to leave one out doesn’t make sense.”

He does agree, though, that stress-testing is particularly useful for navigating a crisis. In normal conditions, standard risk measures based on past volatility can underestimate extreme risks – the so-called ‘fat tails’ – in the portfolio. “The only way you can get an idea of the magnitude of that fatter tail is really by doing stress tests,” says Mariappa.

This was borne out by the survey: 87% of respondents said hypothetical stress tests were either very useful or somewhat useful in helping them navigate the March selloff, while 79% said the same about historical stress tests.

Pimco uses various techniques to measure its exposure to extreme events. It runs stress tests using historical data and variance-covariance matrixes over various periods. These are supplemented with hypothetical stress tests, drawing on input from its risk and investment teams to sketch out custom scenarios.

Then there are what Mariappa calls “blunt shocks” that show what would happen to a portfolio if a particular sector fell by a certain amount.

While these techniques all have their merits, Mariappa admits he has a preference for the blunt shocks – especially in fixed income.

He notes that most historical and custom scenarios, however intricate, come in four main flavours. The first is a recession scenario, with weak growth and low inflation expectations. Then, there is a stagflationary scenario, with higher inflation expectations and lower or muted growth. Next is a Goldilocks environment of higher growth with muted inflation, and finally a growth scenario with higher growth and higher inflation expectations.

“What you will find is, most historical and custom scenarios will fall within those four quadrants,” says Mariappa.

The danger lies in over-engineering the scenarios to the point where they muddy the results. “There’s a level of precision that I fear when we try to over-specify custom scenarios,” he says. More detailed scenarios may be based on assumptions about how different assets behave and relate to each other that may not hold true in a crisis.

“I like broader shocks to get a sense of what is ‘cuspy’ [and] has fatter tails,” says Mariappa. This sort of exercise can help risk managers identify potential correlation breaks and get a sense of how assets might behave in relation to each other during periods of stress, he adds.

Mariappa likens the process of designing stress tests to an optimisation exercise: “If you’re trying to optimise something, the fewer the number of variables and constraints you have, the more optimal the solution.”

The historical and custom scenarios will “give you a sense of stress”, he adds, but the blunt shocks “will help you identify which parts of your portfolio” could run into problems.

Whether in risk management or engineering, then, the simplest designs are often the best.
