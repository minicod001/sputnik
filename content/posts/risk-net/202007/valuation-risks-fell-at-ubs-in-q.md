UBS was able to value its mark-to-model assets with greater confidence in Q2, as the pricing challenges that bedevilled the bank at the height of the coronavirus-induced financial panic ebbed. However, valuation uncertainty remained high relative to pre-pandemic levels.

The Swiss bank pegged the value of its Level 3 assets, those valued using its own inputs, at $8.1 billion as of end-June, and Level 3 liabilities at $14.3 billion. A sensitivity analysis, based on reasonably possible alternative values for the Level 3 inputs used to mark these assets and liabilities, showed that a favourable change would benefit the bank by $824 million, whereas an unfavourable change would cost it $780 million, for a total valuation uncertainty range of $1.6 billion.

This is a far tighter range than the $2 billion disclosed for Q1, when combined Level 3 assets and liabilities totalled $20.7 billion. Still, it’s above the $1.1 billion range reported at end-2019, on $20 billion of Level 3 instruments.

In Q2, valuation uncertainty reduced the most for Level 3 credit derivatives. The range shrunk to $17 million from $72 million over the quarter. It increased for Level 3 equity instruments, to $252 million from $232 million.

### What is it?

Under accounting rules, fair value assets valued using actual quoted prices are designated Level 1, those using other observable inputs Level 2, and those marked-to-model Level 3.

In its quarterly results, UBS quantifies how favourable and unfavourable changes to the unobservable inputs used to price Level 3 instruments would impact modelled fair values. The data does not incorporate interdependencies between Level 1-2 and Level 3 assets.

### Why it matters

When markets for certain assets dried up at the height of the coronavirus-induced financial panic, banks were starved of the observable inputs needed to keep these in the Level 1 and 2 accounting categories. This in part explains why UBS saw Level 3 assets and liabilities grow in Q1 and Q2 versus Q4 2019.

It doesn’t, though, explain why the range of valuation uncertainty narrowed between Q1 and Q2. It could be that calmer markets at the latter end of the second quarter made the price of assets used as proxies for some Level 3 inputs less volatile, which in turn fed through to lower valuation uncertainty for the Level 3 instruments themselves.

Or perhaps, with the benefit of weeks and weeks of post-crisis market data, UBS’s modellers were able to update the range of reasonably possible alternative values for many of these Level 3 instruments to better reflect actual trading conditions.

The bottom line is that UBS is more confident about the value of its mark-to-model assets today then it was at end-March, meaning it’s less likely to take a big hit from a change in assumptions in the immediate future.
