Assets deemed hard-to-value increased by 17% at major eurozone banks over the first quarter.

Level 3 assets, those for which market prices are not available and are instead valued using banks’ own models, totalled €230.7 billion ($271.2 billion) across the [112 significant institutions](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/ecb/pub/pdf/ssm.supervisorybankingstatistics_first_quarter_2020_202007~507ae85838.en.pdf) overseen by the European Central Bank (ECB) as of Q1, up from €197.3 billion three months prior.

These made up 0.96% of total assets as of end-March, up from 0.89% at end-December. Level 2 assets, those valued using observable inputs besides market prices, made up 15.4%, and Level 1 assets, those valued using market prices, 7%

Banks classified as development lenders by the ECB had the most Level 3 assets as a share of their portfolios as of end-March, at 2.61%.

Retail and consumer credit lenders had the second-most, at 1.52%. Small market lenders had the smallest amount, at just 0.26% of their overall assets.

Of those assets classified as Level 3, loans and advances made up 31% of the total, debt securities 24%, and equity instruments and derivatives both 22%. Quarter-on-quarter, Level 3 derivatives increased the most, by 52% to €51.1 billion. The amount of Level 3 equity instruments fell over the three months to end-June, by 4% to €50.8 billion.

### What is it?

The ECB publishes aggregated [supervisory banking statistics](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/ecb/pub/pdf/ssm.supervisorybankingstatistics_first_quarter_2020_202007~507ae85838.en.pdf) for firms designated as significant institutions. The Q1 2020 data covers 112 such firms.

Level 3 assets are instruments that cannot be valued using observable inputs, such as market prices, and are instead marked-to-model.

### Why it matters

Level 3 assets are subject to [model risk](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/6268676/valuation-model-risk-on-the-rise-at-eu-banks), as their value are determined using banks’ own data and assumptions. Changes to these can cause their value to swing around wildly, with unfavourable changes leading to asset write-downs that can eat into banks’ capital buffers. Since the more Level 3 assets a bank has as a share of its portfolio, the bigger these swings can be, regulators and investors keep a close watch on their overall levels.

In the midst of the coronavirus-induced financial panic in March, liquidity for certain products, like [collateralised loan obligations](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7544626/covid-panic-puts-eu5bn-of-commerzs-clos-into-mark-to-model-pen), dried up temporarily, forcing banks to transfer billions of euro’s worth of assets into the Level 3 bucket. Following the aggressive actions by central banks to keep markets running smoothly, it’s likely that some of these have since moved back to the Level 2 or Level 1 categories.

Still, some portfolios not helped by stimulus or liquidity measures may stay stuck in Level 3 for some time to come. Those banks with cutting edge models and reams of historical data should be able to guess their value fairly confidently over a short time horizon. But smaller, less sophisticated lenders may find it harder, and could be in for a shock if they try to offload these assets to a counterparty that doesn’t agree with their valuation.
