In this paper, Andrei Lyashenko and Fabio Mercurio show that the generalised forward market model (FMM) they previously introduced can be effectively extended to make it a complete term-structure model describing the evolution of all possible bond prices as well as of the bank account, which is needed to compute backward-looking term rates. The FMM extension results in a model that is effectively a hybrid between a Libor market model and a Markovian Heath-Jarrow-Morton model, and combines the flexibility of the former with the fine resolution of the latter, while preserving computational efficiency
