The daily value-at-risk (VAR) of Credit Suisse’s trading portfolio surged to Sfr 80 million ($83 million) on average in Q2, up 131% on the prior quarter.

Heightened trading risks linked to credit and rates pushed the total higher. Average credit spread VAR almost tripled from Q1 to Sfr 96 million, and peaked at Sfr 125 million at one point in the second quarter. Interest rate VAR jumped 67% to Sfr 34 million, and peaked at Sfr 44 million.

Credit Suisse also reported three downside VAR breaches in Q2 – days on which actual trading losses exceeded its modelled expectations – compared to two in Q1.

The elevated VAR levels contributed to the higher market risk-weighted asset (RWA) amounts disclosed for the second quarter. These hit Sfr 22 billion in Q2, up 20% on Q1 and 45% on Q4 2019. Credit Suisse said that updates to its market risk models to account for recent volatility added a net Sfr 4.6 billion to this total.

Typically, downside VAR breaches would also have pumped up the bank’s market RWAs, as they increase the regulatory multiplier applied to its VAR-based capital requirement. But in June, Swiss watchog Finma temporarily suspended this mechanism for breaches that aren’t attributable to model shortcomings.

VAR ended the quarter at Sfr 58 million, dramatically lower than the Sfr 100 million recorded at end-March. However this was still far above the Sfr 25 million reported at end-December.

### What is it?

Value-at-risk measures the potential loss due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon to a specified confidence level.

Credit Suisse’s management VAR is calibrated to a 98% confidence level and a one-day holding period. Regulatory VAR, used to generate the VAR-based market risk capital charge, is set at a 99% confidence level and a 10-day holding period.

### Why it matters

Trading risks may have increased over the quarter, but so did trading income. Credit Suisse’s global markets division posted $615 million of profits for Q2, up 71% year-on-year. The unit also made a pretty return on the regulatory capital charged against it – 17%.

This shows that although market risk capital requirements increased in Q2, this didn’t lead to a drag on performance. Finma’s market risk capital relief helped here. If it hadn’t negated the effect of backtesting exceptions on the VAR multiplier, the bank’s overall market risk capital charge would have been higher, and the return on regulatory capital lower.
