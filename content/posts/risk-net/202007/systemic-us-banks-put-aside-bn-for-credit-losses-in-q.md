Reserves set aside to cover shaky credit assets topped $35 billion at the eight US globally systemic lenders in Q2, up some $10 billion quarter-on-quarter.

Provisions for credit losses (PCL) amounted to a staggering 244% of aggregate net income, up from 175% in Q1.

JP Morgan led the group, taking $10.5 billion of PCL over the three months to end-June, up 26% on the prior quarter. The bank reported $4.7 billion in net income.

Wells Fargo followed close behind with a provisions charge of $9.5 billion, which contributed to a net loss of $2.4 billion. The San Francisco-based lender put aside 138% more for credit losses than they did in Q1 – by far the biggest increase out of all eight banks.

Bank of America, Citi and Goldman Sachs also posted higher PCL for Q2 than Q1, of $5.1 billion, $7.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. Net income at these firms totalled $3.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $2.4 billion.

Morgan Stanley was the only big six lender to post lower provisions in Q2 than in Q1: $239 million compared to $273 million. Its net income for the quarter was $3.2 billion.

Custody banks BNY Mellon and State Street, holding smaller loan books, put aside a low level of PCL. BNY Mellon took a charge of $143 million, compared to $169 million in Q1, and State Street one amounting to $52 million, up from $36 million. The banks made $965 million and $694 million, respectively.

### What is it? 
Provisions for credit losses are taken out of income each quarter to cover expected shortfalls in payments from loans and other credit instruments.

### Why it matters
The coronavirus-induced economic shutdown of the US has pushed hundreds of businesses into the red, meaning billions of dollars of loan repayments aren’t being made. This forces the lending banks to write-down loan values, contributing to the huge PCL charges witnessed.

But another factor are banks’ own credit risk models, which assess the likelihood of future loan losses. Under the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) accounting model, firms use their own forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios to size provisions on souring loans. These differ from bank to bank – with some using darker forecasts than others.

Bank executives kept analysts mostly in the dark on the assumptions used in their models, making a relative comparison of their severity impossible. But it’s fair to assume that banks like JP Morgan, which said it takes a conservative approach to its CECL modelling, may post far lower provisions for Q3 if the economy does not degrade further – as it has taken so much out of income to cover losses already.

So far, huge trading and underwriting windfalls have helped offset some of the effect that huge loan-loss provision charges have taken out of net revenues. But if these dry up, as [some expect](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7655021/var-doubles-at-jp-morgan-in-q2), then further PCL hits could start to eat into bank capital buffers, forcing down solvency ratios, which would worry investors and regulators alike.
