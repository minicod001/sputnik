Singapore is set to phase out publication of its key interbank interest rate benchmark within three to four years, with the market to shift to using the new overnight rate.

A [report](https://abs.org.sg/docs/library/sibor-reform-and-the-future-landscape-for-sgd-interest-rate-benchmarks.pdf) released on July 29 by three industry committees recommends the discontinuation of the one-month and three-month tenors of the Singapore interbank offered rate (Sibor) – benchmarks widely used in the loan market – by some time in 2024.

The report also proposes that six-month Sibor should be discontinued after the end of 2021. This follows a 2017 consultation that recommended publication of 12-month Sibor should cease at the end of 2020. The report seeks industry feedback on the proposals, to be submitted by the end of September.

A compounded or term version of the Singapore overnight rate average (SORA) is the recommended replacement for Sibor. Transition of legacy one-month and six-month Sibor contracts on to SORA should take place after the derivatives market has moved from the swap offer rate (SOR) to SORA, scheduled to be finished by the end of 2021, the report says.

Transition of legacy six-month Sibor contracts, which are far fewer in number, can begin ahead of that date, the report adds.

The move to phase out Sibor will make Singapore the first of Asia-Pacific’s so-called [multi-rate jurisdictions](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5454266/after-libor-japan-australia-look-to-multi-rate-future) to fully commit to risk-free rates. Other countries – Hong Kong, Australia and Japan – have sought to reform rather than kill off their interbank offered rates.

Andrew Ng, who heads the treasury team at DBS in Singapore, says the discontinuation of Sibor is a sensible step because the benchmark suffers from the same problem as the outgoing Libor – namely a lack of underlying transactions and a heavy reliance on expert judgement.

The Principles for Financial Benchmarks, issued by global regulatory body Iosco, states that reference rates should be anchored in observable arms-length transactions.

“In the methodology you are supposed to have transactions but you don’t really have many Sibor transactions these days. Most of it is expert judgement, and this is against the Iosco principles,” he says.

Sibor administrator, the Association of Banks in Singapore, and the Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee had previously devised measures aimed at strengthening the benchmark, by including wholesale alongside unsecured interbank transactions. However, testing that was conducted from July 2019 to June 2020 to validate this new methodology, known as Sibor-plus, found that the new benchmark, while robust, was more volatile than Sibor. There was also a “non-negligible” basis between the two rates, the report states.

“They are thinking that if Sibor-plus is so volatile then why don’t we just move to SORA instead,” says Ng. “They’re just going to bite the bullet now.”

### A boost for SORA

The report says the cessation of Sibor will also support the deepening of SORA markets. The Singapore dollar rates market is already switching to SORA from SOR – the fixing currently used for most swaps and some cash products. This is because SOR cannot be calculated should publication of Libor cease after 2021, since its calculation relies partly [on reference to the US dollar Libor benchmark](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6906371/asia-awaits-term-sofr-solution-for-local-benchmarks).

Signs of progress in adoption of SORA have already been seen this year. In May, DBS [priced the first floating rate note](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7544461/singapore-debuts-floater-linked-to-risk-free-rate) linked to the new benchmark, while LCH [launched central clearing](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7547316/lch-debuts-central-clearing-for-sora-derivatives) for SORA swaps in the same month.

LCH plans to further support the transition by switching to SORA for the discounting of the present value of future cashflows of Singapore dollar interest rate swaps, and as the rate used to calculate interest on posted margin, known as price alignment interest (PAI).

The steering committee formed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to oversee the transition to SORA has highlighted a switch to SORA for PAI and discounting as a priority for the second half of this year.

Ng suggests that other jurisdictions in Asia that are currently committed to a multi-rate market may also follow Singapore in the future by transitioning away from interbank rates towards risk-free rates.

“All the central banks want to follow these Iosco principles so others like Hong Kong and Japan I think will also work towards greater use of risk-free rates,” he says.
