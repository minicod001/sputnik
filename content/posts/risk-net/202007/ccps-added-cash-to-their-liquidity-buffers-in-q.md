Major central counterparties (CCPs) stuffed their liquidity portfolios with cash over the first quarter.

Eurex saw its overall qualifying liquid resources, used to honour payment obligations like variation margin, increase by 112% over the first three months of the year, to €59.9 billion. The clearing house’s cash holdings at central banks increased 117% to €57.8 billion, and total cash with commercial banks 130% to €685 million.

In contrast, its stock of highly-marketable collateral dropped 52%, to €5 million.

Liquidity buffers at Ice Clear Credit and CME also swelled, by 71% and 65% respectively. CME saw central bank deposits surge 271% to $84.9 billion and those with commercial banks balloon 18% to $10.5 billion.

The Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (JSCC) had ¥90 billion ($839 million) on account with the Bank of Japan at end-March, flat on the quarter, but increased the amount of cash it stashed with commercial banks by over one-third, to ¥99.9 billion total. Unsecured committed credit lines continued to make up the bulk of its liquidity resources, however.

The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) and Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) were the only two central counterparties of the 10 tracked by Risk Quantum at which liquidity resources fell over the quarter.

At the OCC, a $1 billion drop in highly-marketable collateral offset increased central bank holdings, bringing total liquidity down by just under 1%.

DTCC’s buffers stood out for falling almost 11%. While the firm did see its central bank deposit account more than double in size to $36 billion, and available highly-marketable collateral increase by $600 million, cash deposited with commercial banks fell 31% to $4.8 billion. Liquidity available through secured committed credit lines also dropped, by 18% to $157.9 billion.

Each CCP said its available liquidity resources would have been able to cover all payments required had its single largest clearing participant defaulted in Q1. Eurex, Ice Clear Credit, Ice Clear US, the OCC, LCH Ltd, LCH SA, CME, and the National Securities Clear Corporation division of the DTCC all revised up their estimate of how big this obligation would be in Q1, however.

### What is it?
CCPs are required to publish the size and make-up of their qualifying liquid resources in quarterly disclosures.

The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (CPMI-Iosco) defines eight sources of liquidity for CCPs: central bank cash; secured cash at commercial banks; unsecured cash at commercial banks; secured credit lines; unsecured credit lines; highly marketable collateral; supplementary liquidity; and other resources.

### Why it matters
A CCP’s liquidity resources are supposed to cover settlement payments, variation margin calls, and other payment obligations. Each clearing house took in a huge amount of variation margin in Q1 because of the coronavirus-induced surge in market activity, and instead of investing that cash many appear to have kept it on deposit, presumably so they could quickly meet outgoing payments as they came due.

Top CCPs may keep their cash piles intact for some months to come, as they can’t risk the value of their liquidity buffers falling considering the fragile economy. A sudden member default could panic markets, depressing the price of the securities held by a CCP in its liquidity portfolio. In a worst-case scenario, credit lines may also become difficult to tap, meaning all a CCP would have to rely on to honour payment obligations would be its cash reserves.
