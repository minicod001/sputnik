Dealers report sharp rise in client demand for research

While the sudden re-emergence of volatility in foreign exchange markets has prompted a flurry of trading activity since March, banks have also seen a related surge in demand for research and strategy.

“When market volatility rises, active investment managers typically have a greater interest in engaging with research teams,” says Sam Lynton-Brown, head of G10 FX strategy in Europe at BNP Paribas. “We have experienced a significant increase in client interest in the first half of 2020 compared to previous years.”

Chris Turner, global head of markets and regional head of research for UK and central and eastern Europe at ING, points out that “huge uncertainty in the market” has sparked more interest in scenario analysis, where clients explore the factors that shape a range of possible outcomes.

Turner reports that online readership of ING’s research is “up over 100%” compared to the same period last year.

After a long period of [muted volatility](https://www.fx-markets.com/trading/4768416/who-killed-fx-volatility) in FX – bar the occasional wild day, such as the historic leap in the Swiss franc in January 2015 – traders are scrambling to adjust to zigzagging markets. As a result, many are looking to research and strategy for trading guidance in unfamiliar conditions.

“In the past three years FX research had a hard time because it was a very low vol environment where macroeconomic numbers didn’t seem to be driving markets as they used to. But now things are exciting again and research is very sought after,” says Fabio Madar, co-head of currencies at NatWest Markets.

The type of research required by clients has changed since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic at the start of the year. In February and March, as the market went through a US dollar shortage, investors sought information about movements in the FX forwards space.

But following a series of interventions by the US Federal Reserve to [address that liquidity shortage](https://www.fx-markets.com/foreign-exchange/trading/7558241/appetite-for-renewed-fed-dollar-swap-lines-in-doubt), clients have turned their attention to broader risk drivers.

“As that funding stress has alleviated, investor focus has shifted away from that quite niche and idiosyncratic market towards more typical areas,” says Lynton-Brown.

A primary concern is now central bank activity. Clients are looking into how central banks shape policy, rather than attempting to second-guess the decisions they may make.

“Focusing on the reflexive nature of central banks has taken much greater focus in discussions than the specific policy actions we might expect, because that policy action is so dependent on inputs with a wide degree of uncertainty,” Lynton-Brown adds.

### Adapting to the new normal

As many investors continue to work from home, making in-person meetings a thing of the past at least for now, FX research desks are having to adapt the way they engage with clients.

Banks are setting up video conferences to try and replicate the type of roundtable clients would have normally attended in person, by bringing in experts within a certain area – be that on European politics, UK international trade or Chinese foreign policy.

“Remote working has naturally placed greater pressure on communication and co-ordination,” says ING’s Turner. “In a working-from-home environment, we needed to make our research as accessible as possible and so in addition to written reports we’ve addressed this through more video and podcast offerings.”

Video calls also give banks a chance to cut through the churn of written research that bombards clients’ inboxes, and deliver a short, sharp message.

“We know that clients are inundated with reading research at home and they are interested in having the key points succinctly explained in five minutes over the phone,” says the head of FX sales at a European bank.

Looking ahead, clients’ needs will continue to dictate how FX research is distributed, but some structural shifts might be more permanent than others.

“It may be the case that in the future we revert back to some of the old ways of content delivery, but I would argue that many of the changes which have been made, such as less travel, are here to stay,” says Lynton-Brown.
