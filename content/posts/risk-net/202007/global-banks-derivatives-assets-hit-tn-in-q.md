The positive market value of derivatives positions held by international banks leapt 43% over the first three months of the year to $4.4 trillion, the highest level since Q2 2016.

It’s the largest single-quarter leap in derivatives asset values going back at least five years. Derivatives liabilities – those with negative market values – also increased, by 36% quarter-on-quarter to $5.2 trillion.

Countries with the largest banking sectors saw even more dramatic increases. Canadian banks posted derivatives assets of $266.6 billion in Q1 2020, up 80% on the prior quarter; US banks $514.6 billion, up 74%; Swiss banks $431 billion, up 71%, and UK banks $1.04 trillion, up 41%.

Firms in the UK, Germany and France reported the largest outstanding derivatives positions by market value for Q1.

### What is it?

The BIS publishes data on the balance sheets of [international banks](https://www.bis.org/statistics/about_banking_stats.htm?m=6%7C31) on a quarterly basis. Locational statistics contain data on the geographical and currency make-up of banks’ assets and liabilities, including intragroup business. The consolidated statistics count banks’ country risk exposures on a worldwide consolidated basis. The data is reported at the country level, rather than by individual bank.

Derivatives asset data is reported on a guarantor basis, and derivatives liabilities on an immediate counterparty basis.

### Why it matters
Unprecedented market volatility sparked by the coronavirus crisis caused the market values of outstanding derivatives positions to swing around in sympathy with the assets and benchmarks they referenced.

Billions of dollars’ worth of pay-floating interest rate swaps moved deeply into-the-money as benchmark rates fell around the world in March; currency forwards and swaps zigzagged in value as firms rushed to get a hold of dollars; and put options and other downside hedges on equity positions soared in price as major indexes crashed.

Financial institutions and corporates also rushed into the market to reset existing hedges or to bulk out their portfolio defences, which also contributed to the boom in banks’ derivatives assets and liabilities.

The surge was most pronounced, in dollar terms, among UK banks. This highlights the importance of London as a global financial centre, especially as the home of central clearing. Vast amounts of cleared derivatives made their way through UK-based clearing banks on their way to LCH Ltd, which handles the bulk of cleared interest rate swaps business.
