The sale of preferred stock and strong earnings helped BNY Mellon enlarge its capital base in Q2, pushing its risk-based capital ratio to a record high.

Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital increased by $1.6 billion (+9%) to $20 billion over the quarter, the largest one-month gain for at least six years. Retained earnings, which form the bulk of CET1, increased $623 million quarter-on-quarter.

Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital, made up of issued perpetual debt and preferred shares, swelled by almost $1 billion (+28%) to $4.5 billion. BNY Mellon issued $1 billion of preferred shares on [May 12](https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/press-releases/bny-mellon-announces-pricing-of-public-offering-of-1-billion-of-depositary-shares-representing-interests-in-preferred-stock-05-1.jsp), carrying a fixed dividend of 4.7% up until 2025, and a rate linked to US Treasury securities thereafter.

Tier 2 capital increased $113 million (8%) to $1.5 billion over the quarter.

This capital accretion bolstered the ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs) at the bank to 12.7%, from 11.3% the prior quarter. Its Tier 1 leverage ratio increased to 6.2% from 6% and its supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to 8.2% from 5.6%.

The sharp uptick in the SLR was in part due to a change to the ratio’s calculation ordered by the [Federal Reserve](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7522166/banks-fear-time-limit-on-fed-leverage-ratio-reprieve) in response to the coronavirus crisis. Without this relief, the SLR would have been 7.8%.

### Who said what
“In the second quarter, we opportunistically issued $1 billion in preferred stock, and we think this gives us opportunity to restack our capital down the road. Longer term, our growth is not dependent on increasing risk-weighted assets, which gives us the ability to return at least 100% of capital to shareholders, and we’re confident in our ability to continue returning attractive levels of capital,” – Thomas Gibbons, chief executive officer at BNY Mellon.

### What is it?
Bank capital is separated into three categories for regulatory purposes – Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), additional Tier 1 (AT1) and Tier 2. Collectively, CET1 and AT1 make up a bank’s Tier 1 capital.

Under US rules, banks must maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based regulatory capital ratios. The Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement is set at 4% of average total on-balance sheet assets, the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) 5% of total leverage exposure, while the risk-based requirements fluctuate from bank to bank.

As of Q2 2020, BNY Mellon’s CET1 risk-based requirement was 8.5% of RWAs as calculated using the advanced approaches.

### Why it matters
BNY Mellon came through the Federal Reserve’s recent stress tests in [good health](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7568091/goldman-faces-high-stress-capital-buffer-after-fed-tests), with the lowest peak-to-trough decline in its CET1 ratio of all the US systemic banks. This translates to a low [stress capital buffer](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7501576/the-feds-stress-capital-buffer-relaxed-but-not-relaxing), and in consequence a low all-in CET1 requirement of 8.5%.

Under risk-based measures, then, BNY Mellon has plenty of freedom to deploy surplus capital and pay dividends to shareholders. Gibbons, the CEO, is also keen to conduct stock buybacks when a temporary [ban](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7568091/goldman-faces-high-stress-capital-buffer-after-fed-tests) imposed by the Federal Reserve lapses.

Still, the bank’s managers will have to keep one eye on the Tier 1 leverage ratio, which can fluctuate wildly as deposits flow in and out. This may put a cap on any sizeable capital distributions until the economy is on the clear path to recovery out of the coronavirus crisis.
