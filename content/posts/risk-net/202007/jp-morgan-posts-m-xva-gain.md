Lower funding costs helped JP Morgan book a $510 million gain from derivatives valuation adjustments (XVAs) in Q2, its largest such windfall for at least five years.

The benefit partly offset a [$951 million XVA loss](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7524816/jp-morgan-takes-951m-xva-hit) in Q1, the biggest on record, caused by a blow out of funding spreads triggered by the coronavirus-induced financial panic.

XVA effects are captured under the “credit adjustments and other” line item in JP Morgan’s quarterly earnings releases, and include all costs and benefits to trading revenues caused by funding valuation adjustment (FVA) and credit valuation adjustment (CVA).

The gain made up 3% of the $16.4 billion of revenues booked by JP Morgan’s corporate and investment bank in Q2, which were up 64% quarter-on-quarter.

The bank disclosed derivatives assets for Q2 of $74.8 billion, down 8% on end-March, and derivatives liabilities of $57.5 billion, down 12%.

### Who said what
“‘Credit adjustments and other’ was a gain of $510 million as ... driven by the tightening of funding spreads on derivatives and was a partial reversal of the losses in the first quarter,” – Jennifer Piepszak, chief financial officer at JP Morgan.

### What is it?
JP Morgan “credit adjustments and other” impacts include CVA managed centrally within the corporate and investment bank and FVA on derivatives and certain components of fair value option elected liabilities. These are presented net of associated hedging activities and net of CVA and FVA amounts allocated to fixed income and equity revenues.

[Credit valuation adjustment (CVA)](https://www.risk.net/definition/credit-valuation-adjustment-cva) reflects the cost of hedging a client’s counterparty credit risk over the life of the trade. This includes the point-in-time view of CVA reflected in the profit and loss (P&L) statement.

[Funding valuation adjustment (FVA)](https://www.risk.net/definition/funding-valuation-adjustment-fva) is the cost that arises when a dealer is unable to directly pass variation margin from an out-of-the-money client to an in-the-money client. The dealer then has to fund the margin itself, generating a cost.

### Why it matters
At JP Morgan [FVA is calculated](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7526696/fva-losses-back-in-spotlight-after-coronavirus-stress) using the estimated market funding cost, based on the bank’s own credit risk. Credit default swap (CDS) spreads for the bank offer a good proxy for this risk, and shed light on the wild swings in XVAs in recent quarters.

Spreads on JP Morgan’s five-year CDS jumped 224% between March 2-20, explaining the first-quarter increase in FVA. But from a peak of 180 basis points reached on March 19, the spread then collapsed 67% to 59bp by June 30. This means it’s now much cheaper for the bank to fund required margin payments than it was three months ago.

However, the CDS spread is still roughly double where it was at end-2019, and is far more volatile than before the coronavirus crisis. If large parts of the US economy are once again forced into lockdown to combat the spread of the virus, spreads could jump up once again, inflicting XVA losses that would cancel out last quarter’s gains.
