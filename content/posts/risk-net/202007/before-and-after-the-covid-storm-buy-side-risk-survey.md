{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Wide-ranging survey reveals what worked and what didn’t in March – and what will change as a result_{{< /quote >}}

In September 2018, JP Morgan analysts made an eerily accurate prediction: that the next financial crisis would strike in 2020. What they didn’t see coming was the cause of the crash.

That cause was, of course, Covid-19. As economies around the world went into lockdown, markets quaked. The S&P 500 suffered a series of sharp knocks, tumbling 12% on March 16 in one of the steepest daily drops on record. Bid-ask spreads jumped for most asset classes that month. In the hard-hit US corporate bond market, the spread between investment-grade bonds and Treasuries widened to levels not seen since 2009.

In the words of Dan Bradley, chief risk officer (CRO) at Mariner Investment Group, the pandemic delivered “an exogenous shock” to the financial system.

“It really came out of the blue,” he says. “It shocked the system, but it had nothing to do with the system. It was a health crisis. It isn’t part of the financial system, but it totally disrupted the system. That’s one of the things that will change the way people think going forward.”

For Tatiana Segal, CRO at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the velocity of market moves “was very different” from what happened in 2008, resulting in a shock of a similar magnitude but one that was “instantaneous or at least compressed”.

Sudi Mariappa, global head of portfolio risk management at Pimco, says the experience will lead to a “sharpening” of risk management tools: “The markets evolve. Different risks evolve. We’ve got to constantly evolve.”

A recent Risk.net [survey](https://d.docs.live.net/media/download/1047451) of buy-side firms bears this out. Two-thirds of respondents plan to make changes to their risk management practices as a result of the crisis – among them, adding new hypothetical stress scenarios as well as revising existing ones. Other actions cited by respondents include revamping the content of risk reports and reducing risk limits.

The vast majority of respondents – nearly 90% – said stress tests using hypothetical scenarios were a useful tool for navigating the selloff in March. Value-at-risk, on the other hand, was deemed less useful, although it is widely used.

The wide-ranging survey of buy-side risk management also revealed the growing importance of liquidity risk. In a turnaround from normal times, it convincingly overtook operational hazards to become the second-biggest source of risk – a close runner-up to investment risk.

The degree of liquidity risk varied across asset classes. While 77% said liquidity conditions in equities met their expectations, only 46% said the same about credit markets. In foreign exchange and rates, 70% and 62% said their ability to transact during March matched expectations. One result of the crisis: 45% of firms plan to run more severe liquidity stress tests in the future.

Overall, though, investors seem to have weathered the crisis reasonably well. There were relatively few VAR breaches, with around 14% of portfolios incurring more than 10 in March. Just over 13% of respondents said they were forced to sell positions to meet margin calls.

The firms were polled in June, and comprised asset managers, hedge funds, insurance companies, pension funds and other institutional investors around the world. The survey drew 158 responses. Over 85% of respondents were risk managers, and more than 40% were at large firms, with at least $100 billion in assets under management.

In the coming days, Risk.net will publish in-depth articles on the main findings of the survey, along with a series of interviews with CROs at firms including AllianceBernstein, Mariner, Pimco, PGGM and UBS Asset Management.

### Ringing the changes

The main change – planned by 71% of those firms that intend to adjust their risk management practices – is to adjust the content of risk reports.

Producing “meaningful” reports is something Bradley at Mariner is focused on. He says part of his job is to take the usual battery of risk measures, including VAR, and share the results in a way that will inform positioning and portfolio management. This means risks are factored in ahead of time, when sizing and hedging positions, reducing the need to take drastic action in the middle of a crisis.

The second-most widely planned change, flagged by 56% of the firms, is to add new hypothetical stress scenarios to their libraries. The next three popular improvements in the pipeline are supported by roughly equal shares of the respondents – 46%, 45% and 44% – with two of them also relating to stress-testing. These are respectively: to revise existing hypothetical stress scenarios; to reduce risk limits; and to apply more severe scenarios in market liquidity stress tests.

Firms also plan a host of other changes to market liquidity risk management. These include introducing or adjusting concentration limits and reducing their stressed exposure to margin calls.

Pimco’s Mariappa says the answers show that firms want to “do more of everything on the checklist”.

“During periods of stress, there’s not one number or one framework or one checklist that works,” he explains, drawing an analogy with flying an aeroplane. “Many times, you can do it on autopilot or fly-by-wire, which has one reading you’re looking at. When you hit a period of turbulence, it’s not just [one thing], it’s not just volatility – there are many things that you need to take into account.”

### Stressing the point

For 87% of respondents, stress-testing using hypothetical scenarios was very or somewhat useful in helping them navigate the turmoil in March, while 79% said the same about stress-testing using historical scenarios.

Mariappa suggests why stress-testing is important: “In most scenarios, such as unstressed ones, volatility measures can be the most useful. But when looking at fat-tail events, the only way you can get an idea of the magnitude of that fatter tail is really by doing stress tests.”

For that reason, some risk managers interviewed by Risk.net are “shocked” and “surprised” at the frequency of stress tests at many other firms.

According to the survey, more than 40% of investors run tests only quarterly or annually. Fewer than one-quarter run them daily. And more than 60% of firms that use hypothetical or custom scenarios review them only quarterly or aannually

<img style="float:right; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; width:320px;" src="/img/BeforeAfterCovid3.png"></img>

“I was kind of shocked that the frequency [of stress-testing] was anything other than daily. Portfolios are dynamic, markets are always moving, and inputs are always changing. I would expect people to be running these daily to see how they’re changing and evolving,” says Mariner’s Bradley. “Monthly is probably the borderline of how often you want to review the inputs.”

Andrew Chin, CRO and head of quantitative research at AllianceBernstein, says the crisis has also exposed firms’ overreliance on past experience when creating stress scenarios: “I think we have to design better stress tests and scenarios going forward, based on how we can imagine things to be and how bad things can get.”

These scenarios may feature non-financial risks, which were considered less often before the pandemic, such as geopolitics and technology.

The crisis also has implications for the kind of asset correlations that future stress tests should assume. “I suspect that, because interest rates are so low, bonds will not be as effective a diversifier for equities as they have been for the last 20 years or so,” says Chin. This could in turn have a big influence on future decisions around asset allocation.

### Lowering the VAR

Three-quarters of respondents to the Risk.net survey use VAR to measure portfolio risk, second only to portfolio volatility. But asked how useful it had been during the selloff, one-third said it was not useful, and just over half said it was only somewhat useful.

“VAR is a suitable measure of risk 99% of the time – for the normal days. But risk management is about the 1%,” says Daniël Schotanus, strategy specialist at Dutch quant fund Transtrend. “Traditional VAR methods don’t function properly for that reason.”

Risk managers are well aware of VAR’s limitations, and use it accordingly.

The survey suggests most funds customise VAR to their needs. Methodologies that account for the tail of the distribution are more widely used than the simpler variance-covariance approach. Close to 40% of respondents use a 90% confidence level, and most of them calculate VAR over a one-day horizon – meaning breaches are expected once every two weeks. That suggests many firms use it as an early-warning system, rather than as a true measure of potential losses.

“During the selloff, VAR alerted us to the fact markets had got riskier,” says Christopher Reeve, director of risk at Aspect Capital in London.

The range of lookback periods, from under one year to over 20 years, also suggests fund managers are tailoring VAR models to their individual investment objectives.

This may also explain the relatively low number of VAR breaches reported by respondents. Over 60% said the portfolio that had the most VAR breaches at their firm registered four or fewer breaches. The problems were mostly in equity portfolios, with 55% saying these experienced the most breaches during the selloff in March, compared with around one-quarter who said credit and rates portfolios saw the most breaches.

Despite its limitations, VAR’s big advantage is its simplicity, which makes it attractive to both regulators and investors.

In the Risk.net survey, 10% of respondents said they planned to add VAR models to their toolkit, compared with 5%, who planned to scrap them.

### Tackling a drought

For the most part, asset managers weathered the liquidity crisis in March.

Funds worldwide suffered heavy redemptions that month. For example, data from the European Fund and Asset Management Association shows that net outflows from Ucits funds totalled €313 billion ($358 billion), or nearly 3% of their net assets.

But only up to €100 billion in Ucits and alternative investment fund assets – equivalent to just 0.64% of the regulated market – were subject to temporary suspension of redemptions and other liquidity management measures during the market stress, according to the European Securities and Markets Authority.

Still, the sudden [dropoff in liquidity](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7504371/swap-liquidity-slumps-as-treasury-stress-spreads) seemed to catch some managers by surprise.

In the Risk.net survey, 60% of respondents said overall liquidity conditions met their expectations. However, experiences differed markedly across asset classes. Equity markets came top, with 77% of respondents saying liquidity conditions met their expectations. In foreign exchange, 70% said liquidity was as expected, and 62% said the same about rates markets.

It was a different story in credit and commodities, where a majority of respondents – 54% and 53% respectively – said liquidity was worse than they expected.

Overall, liquidity risk took on greater importance as [trading conditions worsened](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7505206/us-treasury-market-holds-its-breath-after-high-drama). Only 4% of respondents ranked liquidity as their most important source of risk in normal times. In March, it became the most important source of risk for 35% of respondents. Another 39% ranked it second, behind investment risk.

“It takes the true experience of an illiquidity event to really understand it … to really see what happens and how illiquid things become,” says Bradley at Mariner.

“It is definitively going to be on the radar of risk managers and senior management. You’ll see it in how they’re defining their investment programmes, where they deploy leverage and where they choose not to deploy leverage. It will become part of the investment decision, where people will ask ‘what investments are we making?’ and then ‘how are we classifying liquidity?’.”

According to the survey, 75% of asset managers already run some form of liquidity stress test. In most cases – 74% and 60% respectively – these tests measure the time and cost to exit positions.

Fund managers are also trying to understand the behaviour of their investors and avoid concentrations of similarly minded end-clients.

“We like to have where possible a non-concentrated diverse client base – a mix of clients with different return objectives and time horizons,” says Eoin Murray, head of investment at Federated Hermes.

This helps ensure that not all investors look to pull out their money at the same time.

At Kames Capital, the UK arm of Aegon Asset Management, the risk team tracks the past behaviour of clients, where possible, to model the possible redemption scenarios under various market conditions.

The survey results suggest liquidity risk management remains a work in progress at many firms: a number of planned changes to risk management relate to liquidity risk.
