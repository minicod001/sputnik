A handful of European lenders would see their core capital ratios fall below regulatory minimums under a prolonged coronavirus-induced recession, a new stress test by the [European Central Bank](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ssm.pr200728_annex~d36d893ca2.en.pdf?731039993a2a10392e3b7679d1669fb5) (ECB) shows.

The so-called vulnerability analysis tested 86 top banks against three scenarios: one based on the European Banking Authority’s (EBA) 2020 baseline stress test scenario, and two calibrated for the Covid-19 crisis. In the worst-case Covid-19 scenario, eurozone GDP is estimated to decline a cumulative 6.3% over the tests’ three-year horizon, and by a greater amount in the first year than the economy suffered during the global financial crisis.

Under this scenario, the banks’ weighted average CET1 ratio is projected to decline to 8.8% from an end-2019 starting point of 14.5%. This is above the 6.6% [aggregate minimum threshold](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/banking/srep/srep_2019/html/aggregate_results_2019.en.html#toc3) for significant institutions, which is the sum of a 4.5% Pillar 1 charge and 2.1% Pillar 2 Requirement (P2R). In March, EU authorities [permitted banks](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7504606/ecb-buffer-releases-cut-top-banks-required-capital-by-over-eu350-billion) to “operate temporarily” below Pillar 2 Guidance and capital conservation buffer amounts, which are normally included in regulatory minimums.

Though the banking system as a whole would be able to withstand this severe Covid-19 shock, the ECB said “a number of banks would need to take action to maintain compliance with their minimum capital requirements”, although some may be spared because of the effects of additional support measures regulators could introduce.

Banks at the 25th percentile of the distribution would see their ratios drop to 6.8%, just 20 basis points clear of the minimum threshold. As P2R amounts are determined on a bank-by-bank basis, not all banks in this group are subject to the minimum 6.6% requirement. Some will have higher P2Rs, others lower.

Of the net 570bp of weighted average capital depletion projected under the severe scenario, 550bp was attributed to expected loan impairments and provisions and 130bp to trading losses. These effects were counteracted somewhat by net interest income gains, which were projected to add 890bp to capital under the severe scenario, compared to 920bp under the baseline Covid-19 scenario and 970bp under the 2020 stress test baseline scenario.

### What is it?

The ECB conducted a vulnerability analysis on 86 significant institutions overseen by the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) between April and July, to gauge the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their capital positions.

The European Banking Authority’s stress testing methodology was used as the basis for the analysis, including the assumption that bank balance sheets stay static over the three-year scenario time horizon.

Individual banks’ results will inform the upcoming round of Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process [(SREP)](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/banking/srep/srep_2019/html/index.en.html) analysis.

### Why it matters

Like the [Federal Reserve’s](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7568806/feds-covid-scenarios-far-harsher-than-latest-stress-tests) similar Covid-19 scenario analysis, the ECB tests fail to provide a clear picture of banks’ vulnerability to a prolonged pandemic-induced recession. Not only has the ECB refused to disclose the number of banks that could fall below minimum risk-based capital requirements, it’s not said what the minimum thresholds for these banks even are. Nor did it report how many additional banks could have fallen short without the impact of already-introduced [relief measures](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7511896/eu-banks-eye-bad-loan-relief-from-state-guarantees).

In addition, the agency offered no analysis of how leverage-based capital ratios would fare under the scenarios. This is a significant omission, as in the [2018 EBA stress tests](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/6091701/deutsche-barclays-breach-leverage-ratios-in-eba-stress-tests), some banks that aced the adverse scenario on risk-based measures fell short on their leverage-based counterparts.

Finally, a large chunk of anticipated capital generation over the three-year scenario horizon is projected to come from net interest income. Under the worst-case simulation, firms are expected to make just 80bp less than under the pre-pandemic EBA scenario. This may be wishful thinking on the regulator’s part.

Whatever the practical utility of the test results, analysts and investors will be keen to hear from banks on their individual performances, especially as this data will be used to inform SREP reviews, which are used by the ECB to set P2R amounts.
