With foreign exchange settlement risk on the rise, CLS is considering creating a second-tier settlement system for emerging market currencies that are not eligible for its main service, in a bid to encourage a wider adoption of payment-versus-payment (PvP) settlement methods.

The issue was discussed during the July 15 meeting of the New York Fed’s FX committee (NYFXC) in response to an increase in settlement risk in emerging market currencies deemed ineligible by regulators for use at CLS.

“During the meeting we discussed whether we should explore a simpler mechanism which would allow us to still provide a PvP service to mitigate settlement risk across these EM currencies, which primarily settle against the US dollar and the euro,” says Marc Bayle de Jessé, chief executive of CLS.

“We are acting as a catalyst by bringing the discussion to the table, because we want to increase awareness of settlement risk.”

FX settlement risk – the danger that a firm pays currency it has sold but fails to receive the currency it has bought – can be eliminated by using a PvP system. CLS’s service, CLSSettlement, sees each counterparty pay it the currency being sold, and it then pays out the bought currency only if the sold currency is received.

The latest Bank for International Settlements’ Triennial Survey shows daily gross payment obligations worth $18.7 trillion in December 2019. Of this, $8.9 trillion of FX payments were settled without PvP protection (see figure 1).

According to the BIS, the proportion of trades with PvP protection has fallen from 50% in 2013 to 40% in 2019. The decline is driven by an increase in the amount of trades in CLS-eligible currencies settled without PvP protection – for example ‘give up’ trades from a prime broker – and by the growth in non-CLS currencies, which are largely settled outside a PvP environment.

The share of total turnover for CLS-ineligible currencies has jumped from 14%, or $800 billion, in 2013, to over 18%, or $1.25 trillion, in 2019 (see figure 2).

CLS says a stripped-down settlement structure for these ineligible currencies could help reduce settlement risk. This would see emerging market currency netting done only on a single-pair basis, rather than the multi-pair process that is currently used for the 18 CLS-settled currencies.

While this would simplify the process of onboarding new currencies, netting efficiencies for that single pair would be significantly lower than if it were part of a multi-pair run, and the reduction in funding requirements for users would be smaller.

CLS says its clients see their funding requirements cut by 96% or more through multi-pair netting. This is because, for instance, a user’s US dollar obligations from all trades against that currency could be net down to a single payment.

But FX Markets understands that single-pair netting, also known as bilateral netting, would only achieve reductions of between 60% and 70%.

“If we end up with these bilateral netting solutions, there will be benefits in terms of liquidity savings, but they would not be as great as with CLSSettlement. However, a bilateral netting solution with PvP settlement would be equally beneficial in mitigating systemic risk and settlement risk, and realising the cost savings from eliminating those risks,” says Bayle de Jessé.

A second component of the proposed new system would revolve around the legal concept of settlement finality, which can differ between countries. CLS countries have agreed definitions of finality, and emerging market jurisdictions that want to join would usually need to [tweak their domestic rules](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5811236/cls-seeking-legal-fix-for-brexit-settlement-threat) to match. But a simpler model could see users rely only on the finality rules in the EM jurisdiction.

“Changing the law in a country to ensure finality compatibility with CLS’s governing law is usually a necessary step for a currency to join CLS,” says Bayle de Jessé. “But if we were to do PvP between one non-CLS currency and the US dollar, for instance, we would only have to rely on what rules exist in those two countries, and provided we have simultaneous settlement and sufficient legal certainty, we would align ourselves to the regional laws and make sure that the service is safe.”

The hope is that replacing the multilateral, strictly standardised settlement finality model with a series of tailored PvP mechanisms with single countries would boost adoption by firms in a wider range of countries and reduce settlement risk.

A third component being discussed is the replacement of a system based on central banks in favour of quasi-central banks and commercial banks. CLS has accounts with each of the 18 central banks whose currencies are part of its settlement system. Funds paid and received by its members are exchanged through these accounts.

The challenge of operating in emerging market countries that recognise CLS only as a foreign entity presents a practical and legal hurdle to onboarding more currencies. To overcome this, the new system would make use of third-party banks acting as an intermediary between CLS and the local central bank, and allowing the transfer of funds.

“When access to central banks is not possible, we would explore the use of quasi-central banks, for instance, to have accounts which are identified in the book of the central bank but not in our name, and somehow protected by the fact that it's a kind of a sub-account of a key participant there,” says Bayle de Jessé. “Or, in the case where this is not possible, then use a commercial bank in which to hold the funds, in which case the commercial bank would have to secure the way the money is held.”

### Strengthening the FX Code

At the July meeting, the NYFXC also discussed the possibility of strengthening principles 35 and 50 in the FX Global Code related to the management and reduction of FX settlement risk as part of the Global Foreign Exchange Committee’s [triennial review](https://www.fx-markets.com/regulation/7517466/debelle-regulation-could-be-helpful-to-fx-code) of the code.

During the meeting, Lawrence Sweet, a senior vice-president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that “such strengthening could reflect industry perspectives on the challenges and opportunities for increasing the use of PvP when available, and for promoting the appropriate measurement and control of FX settlement risk when PvP is not used”.

While none of the options discussed in the meeting come close to achieving the same results of CLSSettlement, CLS says it is willing to accept some trade-offs in order to see the wider financial ecosystem addressing the growing problem of settlement risk, says Bayle de Jessé.

Update, Aug 3: This article was updated to clarify the NYFXC did not express a view on whether it is willing to accept some trade-offs.
