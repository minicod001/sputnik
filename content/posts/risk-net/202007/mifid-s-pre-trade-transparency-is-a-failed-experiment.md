{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Market participants say benefits of altering pre-trade transparency rules are small_{{< /quote >}}

Market participants fear Europe’s rules on how large dealers and venues disclose pre-trade quotes might not be worth salvaging as part of an [upcoming review](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7154086/why-europes-markets-might-need-mifid-iii) of regulation.

A European trading venue source labels pre-trade transparency as a “failed experiment” and warns that trying to improve it would bring regulators and legislators to a “dead end”.

The European Union’s second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ([Mifid II](https://www.risk.net/topics/markets-in-financial-instruments-directive-mifid)), which came into force in January 2018, included rules to increase the amount of price information available to investors in the EU’s fixed income and derivatives markets. The rules require trading venues, together with large dealers identified as [systematic internalisers](https://www.risk.net/topics/systematic-internaliser-si), to disclose an instrument’s executable quotes before agreeing the trade. The obligation can be waived if the quote is determined to be in an illiquid instrument or is for a large-volume trade.

But market participants complain that the resulting data is largely [unusable](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6511801/use-cases-for-mifid-ii-data-prove-elusive). The European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) is looking at ways the rules can be tweaked to improve this, but banks and venues say the benefits of revising the rules for [pre-trade transparency](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5379136/platforms-win-small-on-day-one-of-mifid-ii) are slim.

Instead, some sources say legislators should focus on improving pre-trade transparency’s sibling, [post-trade transparency](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7649641/improving-mifid-post-trade-transparency-splits-markets), which involves the publication of trades already executed.

The purpose of pre-trade transparency is to give investors information they can use to place competition pressure on their dealers. Investors would be able to use disclosed quotes from the same bank or quotes by other dealers to benchmark against quotes they receive.

But pre-trade information was already being made available before the start of Mifid II, and venues in particular have been making it available so as to entice institutional investors to use their platforms.

“Pre-trade transparency is much more usefully made available by trading venues anyway because that is their stock in trade,” says Alex McDonald, chief executive of the European Venues and Intermediaries Association (EVIA).

He continues: “All trading venues make the prescribed pre-trade information available via their own compliance portals. The review process should consider how market participants want to view and ingest that transparency. The way it is done under Mifid II does not publish the data in the form that anyone wants, and indeed no-one looks at it.”

In addition, market-makers (some of which became systematic internalisers under Mifid II) disclose indications of interest – non-binding prices at which they are interested in buying a security – or so-called ‘axes’ where traders indicate an interest in buying or selling a security.

“What we see in pre-trade transparency is that information is already available, not only from Mifid transparency but [also], for example, indicative pricing and axes distribution,” says Stephane Malrait, head of market structure and innovation for financial markets at ING. “So we don’t think we should make more instruments subject to pre-trade transparency, but perhaps look at ways to reduce the industry cost and effort to deliver pre-trade reporting. There is potentially much more added value for industry participants in post-trade transparency.”

### Bureaucratic nightmare

Part of the reason Mifid II has not produced usable pre-trade data is that many instruments benefit from a waiver to the pre-trade transparency obligation, meaning very few quotes are published.

Waivers are granted to all quotes in an instrument that is deemed to be illiquid by Esma. There are also two size-based waivers for instruments that are deemed liquid. The first, known as large in scale (LIS), is for a trade offered by any market participant that is larger than the average size of orders within that asset class. The second, known as size-specific-to-instrument (SSTI) is for trades larger than a minimum size threshold, offered specifically by dealers using their own capital while trading off-venue or on request-for-quote platforms.

The venue source says Esma had taken a very cautious stance when determining the relevant thresholds, to protect dealers against the premature leakage of information on potential trades that the bank might then struggle to hedge.

As quotes are published before a trade has taken place, it risks the dealer winning the trade but then being unable to place a hedge before a rival trader is able to use the information to move the market against them.

Size waivers were therefore set low, and the threshold of trades per day that an instrument needs to be deemed liquid was set high.

In March, Esma [proposed](https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-consults-mifir-transparency-regime-non-equity-instruments) cancelling the SSTI waiver as a way to reduce the number of quotes benefitting from waivers and simplify the regime, labelling SSTI as “bureaucracy without added value”.

At the same time, Esma would lower the LIS threshold so as to protect liquidity providers, but the minimum trade size to receive an LIS waiver would still be above the existing level of the SSTI threshold.

According to Esma’s analysis, this would only make a relatively small number of additional quotes subject to transparency requirements. If the SSTI hadn’t been in place in 2018, just 6% of waiver requests that were granted would have been refused instead.

### Different waive length

Banks and venues, however, caution against abolishing SSTI. McDonald of EVIA says although SSTI is the least used waiver at the moment, it could become more important in the future once more instruments are deemed liquid.

“We firmly advocate the maintenance of the SSTI for pre-trade,” says McDonald. “Esma suggested removing it in their recent consultation, but that reaction was not based on any apparent evidence as far as we can see.”

Waiver requests work in a waterfall. Firms must first assess whether their trade is liquid. If it is, they can’t get a waiver for illiquidity and so must assess whether the size is larger than LIS. If it isn’t, then they must assess whether they can use the SSTI waiver.

Mifid II gradually requires Esma to tighten liquidity thresholds so that more instruments are deemed liquid, and to raise LIS thresholds. Esma is still on the first phases of liquidity determinations for [bonds](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5373181/only-1-of-bonds-caught-in-first-wave-of-mifid-transparency) and derivatives, and so more instruments are expected to become liquid once it lowers the average number of trades for each instrument threshold. That means the SSTI could become more relevant as the liquidity waiver is used less often.

McDonald says firms have not recorded the use of the SSTI waiver in transaction reports not because it is an unhelpful waiver, but simply because the current Mifid phase one thresholds mean fewer transactions need to make use of SSTI.

“To date, most instruments have either been illiquid or masked by the low preliminary threshold level of LIS. Current datasets cannot inform you whether SSTI is useful or not, it just shows we are at level one of four phases of Mifid transparency staging. So to have any conclusion to remove SSTI is to be premature and misplaced,” says McDonald.

It is also not entirely clear how much more data would come to the market as a result of removing the SSTI waiver, if the LIS is simultaneously lowered as part of the reforms.

The venue source says part of the problem is that regulators don’t have much wiggle room to expand the scope of pre-trade transparency without starting to put dealers at a disadvantage. They believe regulators will still take a cautious approach after the review, even if they cancel SSTI. Dealer sources agree with that analysis.

“When you look at the proposal to scrap pre-trade SSTI and lower pre-trade LIS, we would get a more simplified structure, however you would have to significantly lower the LIS threshold to a point where we aren’t putting undue risk on the market,” says Matthew Coupe, a director of market structure at Barclays. “If you didn’t, you would then have to have in place a percentage of LIS, and this would still deliver two different thresholds, and therefore would not be simplifying the structure.”

### Mixed views on the buy side

Vincent Dessard, a senior regulatory policy adviser at the European Fund and Asset Management Association, says asset managers also want to keep pre-trade waivers as they are today. Buy-side firms that need to make large portfolio reallocations potentially face the same risks as dealers if the information leaks into the market too early.

“We would prefer to keep the waivers for pre-trade,” says Dessard. “We think it would be detrimental for European investors to remove waivers for pre-trade as we wouldn’t be able to get the best execution for our clients. There should be a move to improve post-trade data first and maybe then improve transparency for pre-trade, but it should be a two-step approach, starting with post-trade.”

Adam Jacobs-Dean, a managing director at hedge fund lobby group the Alternative Investment Management Association, says their membership was divided by the Esma consultation.

“There was some support for deleting SSTI for pre-trade from members,” he says. “We do see a case for changes on the pre-trade side, but the nature of conversations with members mainly focused on improving post-trade.”

Post-trade transparency rules require the public disclosure of the price and quantity of trades after execution. Trades can benefit from a deferral of two days to four weeks if the instrument is deemed illiquid, or the trade is larger than LIS and SSTI thresholds. The patchwork of deferrals has led to problems with fragmented and difficult-to-use data that are similar to those seen with pre-trade transparency.

The venue source says regulators increasing the number of trades that aren’t subject to deferrals for post-trade disclosure poses a lower risk of disrupting hedging strategies than pre-trade transparency. That means more data could be published real-time, becoming useful for market participants as pricing information.

However, some sources do see benefits in Esma’s proposal and still believe Mifid II’s pre-trade transparency regime has a future.

“Pre-trade transparency puts more competition on liquidity providers for price,” says a regulatory expert at a non-bank market-maker. “We certainly found pre- and post-trade transparency to be complementary. But we would agree with the general assessment that if there’s a decision to focus on improving one, we should focus on post-trade transparency first.”
