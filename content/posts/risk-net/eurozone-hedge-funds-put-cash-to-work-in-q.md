The eurozone’s hedge funds started redeploying liquidity over the three months to end-June, after their dash for cash in the first quarter.

As of Q2, hedge funds held €97.4 billion ($115.3 billion) in cash and loans, down some 11% on Q1. At end-March, deposit and loan claims accounted for 20% of total hedge fund assets, their highest share at any time since at least 2008.

Some of this excess liquidity appears to have been ploughed into riskier, higher-yielding assets. Net purchases of shares and other equities hit €2.7 billion over the quarter, compared with net sales of €16.8 billion over Q1. Hedge funds also bought up a net €1.1 billion of debt securities, after offloading €3.6 billion over the three months to end-March.

On the flip side, net sales of instruments classified as “remaining assets and financial derivatives” hit €8.8 billion over Q2, compared with net purchases of €25.7 billion in Q1.

### What is it? 

The [ECB’s statistical warehouse](http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/home.do) publishes eurozone investment fund statistics. Key variables are available at a monthly frequency, while more details are provided quarterly.

### Why it matters

Funds had to increase their liquidity buffers over the first quarter to honour client withdrawals. ECB data shows that hedge funds had €394 billion of investment shares/units outstanding as of end-June, down some 9% on end-2019.

The increase in deposit claims among hedge funds over the period also likely reflected the “flight to safety” mentality which took hold when the coronavirus pandemic broke out. With markets normalising over Q2, it makes sense that funds want to put their cash to work to generate the returns necessary to win back investors. The fact that there wasn’t a larger flow of cash into debt and equity securities over the quarter, however, suggests managers are wary about betting heavily on risk assets this early on in the recovery.
