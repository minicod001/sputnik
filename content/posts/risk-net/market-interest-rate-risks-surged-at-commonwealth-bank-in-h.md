The financial fallout of the coronavirus crisis caused market risk-weighted assets (RWAs) to more than double at Australia’s Commonwealth Bank over the first six months of the year. Capital required to cover interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) also leapt 23% as yield curves flattened in response to the worldwide slashing of rates.

As of end-June, the bank’s total RWAs amounted to A$454.9 billion ($325.7 billion) and its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio 11.6%, barely changed from end-2019.

However, market RWAs surged over the period 129% to A$12.5 billion. The bank said the increase reflected heightened volatility over the first half, which led to elevated value-at-risk and stressed VAR measures – key inputs to the market risk regulatory capital calculation.

The bank’s average daily trading VAR over the first half, modelled at a 99% confidence interval and assuming a 10-day holding period, was A$71 million, up from $34 million over the second half of 2019.

IRRBB RWAs hit A$11.1 billion as of end-June, up from A$9 billion six months prior. These RWAs are used to set the capital required to cover the risk the bank’s net interest income will be clobbered by changes to interest rates. The bank said the first-half increase was a function of rates volatility. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its cash rate from 0.75% at the start of the year to 0.25% in March.

Partially offsetting the net A$9.1 billion of RWAs added because of market- and IRRBB-related increases, Commonwealth Bank posted a A$2.3 billion drop in operational RWAs and $1 billion fall in credit RWAs.

### Who said what?

“Before the coronavirus pandemic, we were already experiencing the earnings pressure of a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. While that represents a headwind in absolute terms, in relative terms, the Commonwealth Bank performs better in a falling rate environment. Our structurally advantaged franchise product mix and our balance sheet settings, help us deliver less volatile earnings through the cycle and generate structurally higher levels of organic capital” – Alan Docherty, chief financial officer at Commonwealth Bank.

### What is it?

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority requires banks under its supervision to hold capital against IRRBB, although this isn’t prescribed by the [Basel Committee’s capital framework](https://www.risk.net/regulation/basel-committee/2441334/basel-abandons-plans-pillar-1-rates-risk-charge).

The charge is intended to cover the risk of a bank’s net interest income getting pummelled by changes in interest rates. Australian banks use their internal models to determine the sensitivity of the net present value of future earnings to changes in the overall level and shape of the yield curve.

### Why it matters

Top banks in other jurisdictions have seen RWAs across risk types bloat in response to the coronavirus crisis. Credit RWAs have typically jumped the most as banks’ internal models and regulator-set standardised formula have reset default expectations in light of the pandemic.

Not so at Commonwealth Bank. The firm’s managers said a more granular calculation of credit RWAs for defaulted exposures adopted over the first half helped offset increases incurred by a deterioration in the quality of its loans. Without this, the overall RWA increase may have been greater than the mere 1% reported.

This may mean in the short term the bank can weather far higher capital requirements for market risk and IRRBB. Still, the capital consumption of its trading desks will be a drag on its returns if they don’t bring in bumper revenues. Trading income over the first half of the year at Commonwealth Bank was A$432 million, down from A$508 million for the second half of 2019.
