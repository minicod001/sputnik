> _Despite posting big losses, funds that track front-month contracts remain popular with investors_

Sometimes, the customer is wrong.

Since front-month oil futures went negative in April, investors have been piling into exchange-traded products (ETPs) that track these contracts. Issuers have responded by closing some products and distancing themselves from the strategy.

At least three major asset managers are in the process of overhauling their oil ETPs.

WisdomTree is [seeking approval](https://www.wisdomtree.eu/en-gb/-/media/eu-media-files/other-documents/faq/faq-proposed-changes-to-wisdomtree-wti-crude-oil-etp-en.pdf) from investors to turn its front-month WTI crude oil tracker – called CRUD – into a multi-tenor investment. The $2 billion fund, Europe’s largest oil ETP, has quadrupled in size since the start of the year.

In changing its strategy, WisdomTree is weighing spot sensitivity – which investors crave – against the need to protect the fund and its counterparties from negative prices. CRUD has swap agreements with Bank of America and Citigroup to deliver the performance of the underlying index.

“Theoretically we know oil can go negative, but watching that on a screen was a new experience for risk management teams and banks. Everyone’s taking risk mitigation techniques right now,” says Nitesh Shah, commodity analyst at WisdomTree in London.

ProShares plans to [make similar changes](https://www.proshares.com/media/documents/PSTII_8K_06252020.pdf?param=1594047111827) to two of its WTI funds, including Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil (UCO) – the second largest listed oil tracker in the US, with $1.6 billion in assets under management. ProShares has swap agreements with Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, RBC, Societe Generale and UBS.

On July 6, Hong Kong-based Samsung Asset Management said its $625 million oil tracker fund would also [ditch its front-month index](http://www.samsungetf.com.hk/en/products/download/03175/530/) in favour of a new, multi-tenor alternative.

ETP issuers have little choice but to change their strategies. At least 13 oil funds closed in the three months to June 5 amid heightened volatility and counterparty concerns. BNP Paribas and Shell Trading terminated swap agreements with WisdomTree, forcing the liquidation of 11 products. Others had to halt the creation of new units and overhaul their investment strategies as counterparties, clearing brokers, exchanges and regulators imposed new risk limits.

Investors seemed not to care. USO, the world’s largest spot oil tracker, was held by 216,000 accounts on the Robinhood online trading platform on April 28, compared with just 8,000 in February, according to robintrack.net.

“The sheer number of accounts is just mind-blowing,” says Ilia Bouchouev, managing partner of Pentathlon Investments and former president of Koch Global Partners. “They’re not big, but it’s still 200,000 less experienced investors buying something different from what they thought they were buying.”

The thundering herd of retail investors pushed the fund’s AUM above $5 billion in early June. Many of them are now regretting their purchases. USO lost more than 72% in the first half of the year. CRUD was down 58%. Front-month WTI futures fell only 28% over the same period.

The massive under-performance is a result of selling low and buying high. After front-month contracts collapsed in April, the funds had to sell out of them at rock-bottom prices and roll into more expensive ones further down the curve. In a double-whammy, they lost on the way down in March and April and then missed the rebound in May.

Some ETP issuers and index providers used unprecedented discretion to reconstitute investment strategies on the fly. In a series of regulatory filings in April, USO changed its investment mandate to include a wider range of instruments, starting with longer-dated WTI contracts and culminating in any oil-related investments. It currently holds WTI futures out to June 2021.

On April 24, Bloomberg advanced June WTI contracts straight to September during the standard roll starting on May 7 for its BCOM indexes. On April 29, S&P Global shifted all of the June expiry WTI contracts in its GSCI indexes to July as an emergency measure.

For some, these changes were a bridge too far. “When I read the USO prospectus, it feels like they can now do pretty much anything they want,” says Bouchouev.

But Bouchouev also sees a silver lining. The subsequent reckoning with investors has forced many oil funds to review their strategies. That could give rise to a new generation of more sophisticated ETPs that minimise roll costs – for instance, by dynamically taking long and short positions – and deliver better long-term performance for investors.

“I think there is significant demand for these more sophisticated strategies that would allow you to go long and short depending on storage data,” says Bouchouev. “That could be a nice way to create a better product to manage this contango and roll. I’m fairly sure that strategy would look better for investors than anything else that currently exists.”

### Counterparty conundrum

April was an extreme case, but rolling front-month futures is a strategy that loses money in almost any environment.

The oil futures curve is typically upward sloping, with longer-dated contracts priced at a premium over near-term instruments – a phenomenon known as contango. This means investors that roll contracts from one month to the next are always selling low and buying high.

Analysis conducted by Bouchouev shows the cost of rolling front-month WTI futures has averaged roughly 20% a year for the past 15 years. Oil prices have been flat over the same period.

The roll cost – represented by the difference between first- and second-month contracts – is viewed by some as a synthetic charge for commodity storage. This rose to extreme levels in April as Covid-19 lockdowns crippled consumption and left storage tanks overflowing.

Front-month futures are also the most exposed to negative prices – an outcome that was [previously considered remote, or even impossible](https://www.risk.net/commodities/7546071/bachelier-a-strange-new-world-for-oil-options). On April 20, CME-listed WTI crude futures for May delivery collapsed to an intraday low of -$40 a barrel before settling at $10 the following day.

If the contracts had settled at negative levels, swap counterparties that deliver index returns to ETPs would have found themselves in an impossible position. “The big problem with all of these investments is that you have to calculate the investment returns,” says Bouchouev. “If the price is negative, you cannot even calculate the return. It’s mathematically impossible as the definition of percentage returns doesn’t even exist if prices turn negative.”

Some dealers have already hit the escape button.

Shell Trading was the swap counterparty to a range of London-listed oil trackers issued by WisdomTree. From January to mid-May, the largest of these lost more than half its value, but investors kept piling in, pushing AUM in the funds above $500 million for the first time.

The [terms of the agreement](https://www.wisdomtree.eu/en-gb/-/media/eu-media-files/key-documents/prospectus/etf-securities/prospectus---etfs-oil-securities-limited.pdf) meant Shell’s notice period for terminating the swap would jump from 30 days to 12 months if combined assets across the nine products averaged more than $500 million for three consecutive months.

The funds were not exposed to the WTI contract that turned negative, but Shell did not take any chances. On May 21, it [terminated its swap agreements](https://www.risk.net/investing/7548706/wisdomtree-shuts-oil-etps-after-shell-terminates-swap-deal) with WisdomTree, resulting in the closure of eight oil trackers and a carbon fund with more than $580 million in assets.

Shell was not the only swap dealer looking for an exit. BNP Paribas also pulled the plug on three of WisdomTree’s short and leveraged ETPs, after sharp overnight moves triggered “severe overnight gap event” clauses, permitting swap agreements to be unwound. BNP Paribas continues to provide swap services to a range of oil ETPs issued by WisdomTree and others.

Clearing brokers, who would have been on the hook for uncollateralised losses, have also reined in funds that invest directly in futures. RBC banned United States Oil – the world’s largest oil ETP, with nearly $5 billion in assets – from holding near-term contracts or adding to its current positions.

Samsung Asset Management had to appoint new clearers for its Hong Kong-listed crude oil tracker after its original clearer ordered it to diversify its holdings, halt share creations and purchase options hedges after a surge in inflows. The fund’s AUM swelled from HK$83 million ($10.7 million) to HK$5.2 billion ($674 million) in the three months to June 16, causing the number of contracts it held to increase almost 100-fold.

Samsung warned the hedging measures, which represented 2% of the fund’s net asset value at the time, made it “impracticable for the sub-fund to achieve the original investment objective”.

A Samsung spokesperson says the relationship with the original clearing broker – which is subject to a confidentiality agreement – remains valid. “By diversifying in terms of brokers’ profiles, we aim to remain as flexible as we can be in case of possible future unstable market fluctuation.”

The fund, which is down 79% year-to-date, still bears little resemblance to its benchmark, with holdings split between September, October and December contracts. The S&P GSCI WTI subindex, which it tracks, has shed 67% and now references August expiries.

### Rolling over

Samsung now plans to replace the benchmark for the fund on August 7. The new S&P GSCI Crude Oil Multiple Contract index, launched on June 15, splits exposures across the first three WTI futures tenors. Front month contracts represent 55% of holdings, while second month account for 30% and the remaining 15% is in third month contracts.

WisdomTree’s proposal would switch CRUD’s exposure to Bloomberg’s WTI crude oil multi-tenor excess return index. Launched on June 4, the index is floored at zero and equally weights investment across the first three futures contracts.

Spreading investments across three expiries should offer a degree of a protection against any future collapse in front-month contracts. By hitching funds to the new multi-tenor indexes, the funds also aim to reduce congestion. For example, only a third of CRUD’s holdings will be rolled each month, compared with 50% for the single tenor version. Investors have until July 15 to vote on the proposed switch.

ProShares’ twice-leveraged and short oil funds are currently benchmarked to Bloomberg’s WTI Crude Oil subindex, which tracks front-month contracts. The funds intend to ditch this for Bloomberg’s Commodity Balanced Crude Oil Index, subject to regulatory approval. The new index has one-third exposure to a monthly roll schedule two months beyond the next contract, with the remainder split between June and December annual rolls.

As the tide has turned against front-month rolling strategies, some fund managers are feeling vindicated. After launching in 2007, UBS’s Zurich-listed CMCI Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil Index strategy was largely ignored by investors for more than a decade. The fund spreads its exposures across the curve, from three months to three years, where the contango is less steep and the roll cost not so corrosive. In recent months, its assets have jumped almost 10-fold to top $500 million in early June.

“This diversified exposure is about finding the right balance between the rolling costs, the spot sensitivity and the liquidity in the commodity oil futures market,” says Virat Agarwal, head of commodities structuring at UBS.

Another risk management feature sees the fund roll a portion of its holdings each day to avoid congestion. By contrast, front-month trackers – and many commodity indexes – roll their entire futures stash over a five-day window. This means a $1 billion fund would need to buy around $200 million of futures and sell another $200 million each day, a total of $400 million in daily trading. A fund of the same size using UBS’s strategy would roll less than 5% of its exposure daily, equating to just $40 million of trading activity, and spread out across a handful of tenors.

This takes the pressure off UBS’s trading arm, which delivers the benchmark performance to the asset manager via a swap agreement.

“This construction has very much taken liquidity as one of the driving factors in designing the rolling mechanism. The $500 million exposure that we have in this fund is really far away from levels you would be worried about from a liquidity perspective. It represents only $20 million of rolling activity on a daily basis, which is only a very small proportion of what the overall size of the oil market is,” says Agarwal.

Others are using different techniques to minimise roll costs. Deutsche Bank’s WTI Crude Booster index targets the flattest part of the futures curve and is currently referencing contracts expiring February 2021. DWS’s Xtrackers WTI Crude Oil Optimum Yield ETP offers exposure to the index via a swap agreement with Deutsche Bank – former owner of the Xtrackers suite. The fund remains comparatively small, with $24 million in AUM. That partly reflects investors’ preference for greater spot sensitivity.

Amanda Rebello, DWS’s head of passive distribution for UK and Ireland, says the benefits of optimised roll products have been overlooked. “While long-dated futures contracts are not as sensitive to the WTI price when the spot price is falling, the flipside of course is that those longer-dated contracts are also not as sensitive to the spot price when it’s moving up, compared with, for example, a product tracking the front-month futures contract,” she says. “For commodity markets such as WTI, the roll-optimised mechanism can be beneficial, especially for longer-term investors.”

The irony is that optimised roll strategies have managed to replicate the performance of front-month futures more closely than spot trackers, such as USO and CRUD. DWS’s fund is down 35% year-to-date, compared with 28% for front-month futures. UBS’s performance also aligns with front-month futures, down 30% for the year.

And in stark contrast to front-month investment products, UBS has made no changes to its strategy in response to recent price shocks. “With the pressure that was seen at the front end of the curve, market participants had no choice but to diversify the exposure, or move further out in the curve. From our perspective, the index construction has been very robust and we never felt it required a change in methodology, although we are monitoring the markets constantly,” says Agarwal.

“The exposure has been stable [during] the market conditions we’ve seen over the last couple of months. It’s been working incredibly well.”

### Why not Brent?

After WTI crude oil contracts went negative, why aren’t investors looking at funds that track Brent?

ETPs tracking WTI outsell Brent equivalents by almost 10-to-one. USO’s Brent-linked cousin, BNO, had total assets of just $433 million as of June 16. WisdomTree’s Brent tracker, BRNT, is less than a quarter the size of the more popular WTI-linked CRUD.

It’s a question that has stumped some. “That’s actually a bit of a mystery as liquidity is comparable. Maybe WTI marketing is just better,” says one fund manager.

Brent futures listed on the Intercontinental Exchange have a lower chance of turning negative for two key reasons. First, they are financially settled, meaning there is no risk of holders being required to take delivery of oil if they are unable to sell contracts prior to expiry.  Storage constraints also have a lesser impact on Brent pricing. As a waterborne crude, Brent can be stored at sea and delivered anywhere in the world. By contrast, CME-listed WTI contracts reference landlocked regional crude oil accepted for delivery at Cushing, Oklahoma.

“Theoretically, Brent can trade negative. But it is not intuitive that an investor will pay up to sell a Brent futures contract given it’s financially settled. I don’t think the risk is zero, because the exchange does allow for the prices to trade in negative territory, but the risk will be smaller than for a physically settled WTI,” says UBS’s Agarwal.

The International Energy Agency estimates total crude storage capacity of around 5.5 billion barrels including both onshore and floating facilities. Total capacity at Cushing is just 75.8 million barrels. At the end of April, more than 120 million barrels of floating capacity remained available for Brent Available capacity for WTI at Cushing was just 15m barrels, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

These inventory constraints can magnify any shortage or oversupply in WTI. “This is a self-reinforcing cycle: stockbuilds weigh on the front of the curve, which incentivises more stockbuilds, which weighs further on the front of the curve, and so on. In addition, as demand for storage increases, it becomes more expensive, which causes steeper contango,” says Mike Wittner, head of oil market research at Ice.

This steeper contago equates to higher roll-yield costs. Brent tends to trade with a flatter curve and has delivered better roll yields than WTI almost every year since 2009, notes Wittner. There were just two exceptions: in 2014 when new pipeline capacity was installed at Cushing; and 2018, when an outage at a Canadian production facility crimped Cushing-bound shipments.

Fund managers, however, still see limited demand for exposure to financially settled Brent contracts.

“In terms of Brent versus WTI, I think a financially settled contract does not completely capture the fundamental nature of the commodity market. [It is] a physical market, so most investors invest in it because they like the physical aspect of this asset class. This is captured better by WTI,” says UBS’s Agarwal.
