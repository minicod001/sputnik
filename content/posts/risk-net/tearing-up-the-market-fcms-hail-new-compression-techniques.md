> _Advances by vendors and increased competition set to unlock more trades for tear-ups_

Banks sometimes seem less interested in putting on new swaps trades these days than finding ways to clean up old ones.

Compression has been [hailed](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2384166/[compression](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2384166/compression-save-swaps-business-dealers-predict)-save-swaps-business-dealers-predict) as the saviour of the cleared interest rates derivatives market for its ability to achieve staggering reductions in banks’ notional exposures to central counterparties. So-called risk-less [compression](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2384166/compression-save-swaps-business-dealers-predict) – the tearing up of offsettable trades without any change in net risk – already takes place daily on an industrial scale within clearing houses, accounting for most of the mind-boggling $1.7 quadrillion in notional compressed at LCH’s SwapClear since the start of 2014.

Now, dealers are hoping advances by a clutch of vendors in the technology that underpins its beefier brother – risk-constrained compression – will allow them to reap still greater efficiencies across cleared portfolios, upping the frequency of runs at CCPs and bringing a broader universe of trades in scope.

Risk-constrained compression (see box: Risk-less v risk-constrained) allows participants to sweep away more trades by adjusting multiple characteristics, including cashflows, floating leg spreads and interest rate delta.

“Anything any compression provider can do to alleviate pressure on our metrics is helpful to us. The dealers have the biggest opportunity to make use of [advances in] compression because we’re the entity facing the CCPs,” says the clearing head at a large US bank.

As well as clearing up line items and making large over-the-counter portfolios easier to manage, reducing trade notionals through compression translates into very real capital savings for banks: cycles undertaken at LCH in 2016 alone saved clearing banks more than $21 billion in leverage ratio-based capital requirements, according to the CCP.

In this regard, the need for advances in compression has never been more pressing: as well as counting towards a clearing bank’s total notionals for the purposes of the [leverage ratio](https://www.risk.net/regulation/basel-committee/2453524/basel-committee-amend-leverage-ratio-calculation), client exposures also feed into prudential capital requirements and stress test calculations. A [mooted](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5333971/fed-g-sib-plan-threatens-50bp-jump-in-fcm-capital) change to the calculation of the [capital surcharge](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5352441/banks-prepare-for-battle-with-fed-over-g-sib-rules) applied to US systemically important banks, recently proposed by the Federal Reserve, could also see client cleared notionals factored in to a greater extent than at present.

With dealers resource-constrained as well as increasingly capital-conscious, that means rich rewards for the firm that can wring the most efficiencies out of each compression run – leaving the battle lines nicely drawn (see box: Runners and riders).

### Numbers game

At its heart, isolating eligible trades for risk-constrained compression runs is a numbers game. Vendors craft intricate algorithms that root through banks’ trades to determine how to most closely replicate their present risk position with the fewest trades, at the lowest cost. CapitaLab, a division of BGC Brokers, LMRKTS, Quantile, and Nex’s TriOptima, are all touting proprietary methodologies – which aim to bring more trades in scope, and to reproduce them more quickly and efficiently – along with the larger CCPs.

In recent years, TriOptima’s triReduce service has gradually expanded its reach beyond its traditional home turf of bilateral, [risk-constrained compression](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2328632/bilateral-compression-takes-banks-tackle-leverage) to also become the market leader in the cleared space. The vendor already collaborates with six CCPs to provide clearing banks and their clients with [risk-constrained compression](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2328632/bilateral-compression-takes-banks-tackle-leverage) runs, and has crunched $888 trillion in cleared rate swap notionals since 2014.

But TriOptima faces increasingly intense competition. In October, [Quantile](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2476964/derivatives-start-aims-cut-costs-margin-hub) – founded in 2015 by two ex-Morgan Stanley executives – was certified by SwapClear as an approved compression provider, the first to join for nine years, with TriOptima previously the sole incumbent. Clearing banks appear to [relish the extra choice](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5345386/quantile-and-trioptima-face-off-in-cleared-swaps-compression-battle).

Cameron Goh, global head of product management for rates and foreign exchange derivatives at LCH, says clearing members understandably prioritise the compression of their largest portfolios – those denominated in the major currencies – and try to maximise the number of trades they could scrap regardless of provider.

However, as the CCP and vendors’ capabilities have expanded, banks have sought to feed trades denominated in less mainstream currencies into their compression runs too – selecting providers based on their technical prowess.

“Members are prioritising their runs during the week based on multiple currencies, depending on which provider has the capacity to do what,” says Goh. “They get to choose, and that also gets the compression providers to up their game and enhance their offerings. This year we introduced multiple TriOptima runs per week, which means all the other minor currencies that didn’t get the benefits of compression can now gain these operational and capital efficiencies.”

### Breaking new ground

Other CCPs have worked with vendors to break new ground here too. In September, CME Clearing and triReduce completed the first cleared, non-deliverable Brazilian real interest rate swap compression cycle, which removed $328 billion in notionals across 11 CME member banks. CME has also completed four compression cycles for Mexican peso-denominated swaps to date, reducing 26.2 trillion in peso notional, with the latest cycle on November 8 representing a 21% reduction of cleared principal outstanding in the currency at CME.

“Compression demand is based on where clients need the greatest amount of efficiencies,” says Jack Callahan, executive director, cleared OTC products management at CME. “That’s based on where they have the most open interest outstanding. The compression of real and peso portfolios has been based on the clearing of those currencies to the point where enough open interest has been accumulated, so there is a desire to reduce.”

By its nature, risk-constrained compression necessitates a degree of collaboration among bank participants – and, in turn, banks and their clearing clients. Increased competition places a premium on banks’ ability to discern which trades to upload to which providers to benefit the collective.

“It’s a cat-and-mouse game. If no-one signs up: compression doesn’t happen. If everyone is holding their cards close to their chest and not sharing risk positions with vendors: compression doesn’t happen. That’s why co-ordination is required across the industry to avoid compression runs conflicting with one another,” says a capital manager at a large US bank.

Vendors play down talk that the more compression providers there are, the more likely a cannibalisation of trade flow will occur. Compression pools will only fragment if participants feed the same trades to multiple providers on the same day – with game theory dictating whether banks act in the collective interest to achieve maximum offsets.

“In a world where on one day we are doing a run in one currency, and then later on TriOptima do a run in the same or vice versa, it’s the bank’s decision who to submit to – but those runs won’t interfere with each other. There will still be compression within each pool,” says Stephen O’Connor, chairman of Quantile.

Meanwhile, dealers say the way to make the most of multiple compression providers is to loosen their own constraints and allow for a greater degree of variability between the risk profiles of their initial portfolios and those of the post-run, compressed portfolios.

“You are bound by the participant that has the tightest risk tolerance, beyond which you can’t move things around,” says Federico Ottaviani, head of the macro capital and funding solutions team for the investment bank at JP Morgan in London. “The next evolution would be to actually allow the risk to change to a greater extent to take the benefit of potentially reducing the initial margin requirement you have across all dealers.”

### Risk-less v risk-constrained

The two flavours of compression bear some explaining. Risk-less compression allows a clearing bank to tear up eligible trades at the CCP unilaterally. Perfectly offsetting trades are cancelled out, reducing line items and notionals. However, the portfolio risk profile and associated cashflows remain unchanged, as the CCP has to maintain its own risk-neutral position.

Risk-constrained compression, in contrast, allows participants to sweep away a greater number of trades by adjusting multiple trade characteristics – including cashflows, floating leg spread, and interest rate delta. Users receive an optimised swaps portfolio, but one that may not exactly match the risk profile of the one they had before.

To conduct a risk-constrained compression run, participant banks have to upload trades they wish to crunch to a compression provider’s portal along with their tolerance to a change in their market risk profile. The more participants sign up for a risk-constrained run, and the greater their tolerance to a change in risk profile, the larger the pool of eligible trades. Once all trades are uploaded, offsetting positions are cancelled out and participants’ risk positions replaced with a series of standardised trades with the CCP.

### Runners and riders

Not to be outdone by upstart competitors, this November, long-time market leader TriOptima unveiled [Trade Revisions](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5345386/quantile-and-trioptima-face-off-in-cleared-swaps-compression-battle) – one of the most significant upgrades it has made to its triReduce service since inception.

The update is being pitched as a means to bring clearing participants closer to the maximum mathematically achievable compression result by allowing multiple characteristics of an interest rate swap portfolio to be changed, such as coupon payments, floating leg spread, and direction of the trade in the clearing house.

“The more flexibility we have to amend trades, the less impact market risk tolerances have on efficiency. We can do more without requiring participants to change their DV01 profiles significantly,” says Peter Weibel, chief executive of triReduce.

With Quantile and TriOptima already [competing vigorously](http://www.risk.net/node/5345386) in the cleared world, CapitaLab – historically a [non-cleared specialist](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2450170/banks-save-eu35bn-swaptions-compression-drive) – is understood to be poised to enter the market too.

“Our plan is to offer one big combined solution with all rates products – cleared and non-cleared – in one compression cycle: encompassing cleared swaps, bilateral swaps, bilateral swaptions, caps and floors, and forward rate agreements,” says CapitaLab co-founder Gavin Jackson. “The risk offsets in the combined solution enable attractive step-ups in compression and operational efficiency.”

Lucio Biase, founder of LMRKTS, agrees the ultimate prize for all providers are compression offerings that straddle both cleared and non-cleared portfolios, unlocking efficiencies across each.

“With the advent of mandatory clearing and subsequent cleared initial margin and bilateral initial margin exposures stemming from products that are either un-clearable or uneconomic to clear, [and with] exposures spread or ‘boxed’ between CCPs, we have seen greater demand for our services,” he says.

### A really big numbers game

The widespread uptake of compression by banks and CCPs has already helped make a significant dent in the size of the global interest rate swaps market as measured by gross notional outstanding amount.

Notionals for OTC swaps peaked in the second half of 2013 at $585 trillion, according to Bank for International Settlements data, then declined for the next two years, reaching a cyclical low of $385 trillion in the second half of 2015. As of June 30, 2017, notionals stand at $416 trillion – approximately where they were in 2008.

Compression activity at LCH’s SwapClear has been the driver here, its headlock on the cleared rates market leaving it [uniquely placed](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2384964/dealers-have-last-word-derivatives-notionals) to bring the maximum number of participants together on compression runs. The CCP, which claims a 93% share of all cleared OTCrate swaps, and more than 80% of all client-cleared interest rate swaps, has compressed more than $1.2 quadrillion of notionals since November 2014.

In that period, it has grown its offer from the straightforward, risk-less Solo Compression service to a suite of services covering both risk-less and risk-constrained flavours. So far, in 2017 alone it has crunched down $493.7 trillion.

LCH’s Solo and Solo with Blended Rate compression conduct daily runs; CME’s Coupon Blending service, active since 2014, also runs daily. To date, CME has compressed $20 trillion through Coupon Blending.
