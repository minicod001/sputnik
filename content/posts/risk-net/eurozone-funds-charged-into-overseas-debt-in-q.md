Investment funds in the eurozone bought a net €155.7 billion ($185.8 billion) of debt over the second quarter, two-thirds of it issued from outside the bloc.

The funds snapped up almost €103 billion of non-eurozone bonds, the second-largest net purchase on record, after the €111.5 billion bought through Q2 2017. Still, this did not completely negate the net sell-off of €113.5 billion witnessed over Q1.

Net purchases of eurozone debt amounted to €52.9 billion, the highest quarterly total in over six years. Over the first three months of the year, €53.9 billion of eurozone bonds were offloaded by funds.

Net purchases of debt issued by non-financial corporates in the eurozone amounted to €35.3 billion, more than reversing a sell-off of €7.6 billion in Q1. Funds also bought up more eurozone sovereign debt, purchasing €4.6 billion after offloading €32.2 billion in Q1.

In contrast, funds continued to dump eurozone bank bonds, selling €3.6 billion on top of the first quarter’s €2.3 billion outflow.

### What is it? 

The [ECB’s statistical warehouse](http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/home.do) publishes eurozone investment fund statistics. Key variables are available at a monthly frequency, while more details are provided quarterly.

### Why it matters

Funds were bombarded with redemption orders from investors at the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, when the world was on the brink of a financial and economic crisis. The ECB data shows some €157.9 billion of fund units were redeemed in Q1, which had to be honoured by fund managers selling off liquid assets, including bonds.

Over the three months to end-June, this cash and more besides flowed back into the funds. Some €186.8 billion of fund shares were issued, obliging fund managers to buy back some of the debt they had earlier got rid of.

Over recent years, eurozone funds have tended to buy more overseas than domestic debt, so last quarter’s flows are not out of the ordinary. Still, investment patterns could shift if the economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis unfolds unevenly around the world, and between sectors. Struggling eurozone banks, in particular, may be adversely affected if funds continue to shun their debt in the months to come.
