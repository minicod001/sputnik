{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Buy-side risk survey: Andrew Chin suggests ripping up old assumptions and creating crisis ‘playbooks’_{{< /quote >}}

This is the sixth in a series of articles connected to our buy-side risk survey. Click [here](https://www.risk.net/topics/buy-side-risk-survey-2020) to read the rest of the series.

Imagination is usually a key attribute for people in creative industries. But Andrew Chin at AllianceBernstein thinks he and his peers in high finance could do with more of it too.

Although part of his job as chief risk officer is to dream up a variety of scenarios, Chin says the Covid-19 crisis took him by surprise.

“Who would have thought this virus can actually impact every single country? I definitely didn’t think of that myself. How would you have thought that energy and commercial real estate globally would be impacted at the same time, so quickly?”

Chin, who is also head of quantitative research at AllianceBernstein, points the finger at overreliance by risk and portfolio managers on their past experience.

“I think unfortunately we all lack imagination.”

It wasn’t just the economic consequences of the previously unknown virus that stunned Chin. Something strange was happening in markets as well.

“Treasuries are supposed to be very safe assets with very good liquidity, but during the crisis they were at times correlated to equity markets. They were also not liquid at times,” he says.

Stress-testing is supposed to help in these situations, by showing just how bad things can get in a crisis. And to some extent, that was true. In a recent Risk.net [survey](https://www.risk.net/investing/7658331/before-and-after-the-covid-19-storm-buy-side-risk-survey) of buy-side firms, 87% of respondents said stress-testing using hypothetical scenarios was useful in helping them navigate the selloff in March, while 80% said the same about historical stress tests.

That makes sense to Chin. “During the crisis, stress tests and tailed metrics like expected shortfall and value-at-risk were more important for me because they really just care about the tails of the distribution,” he says. “And during March, in terms of how investment strategies were performing and how liquidity was performing, they were definitely tail events rather than some part of a normal distribution.”

But Chin acknowledges it is “very hard” to imagine a true “black swan” event for a stress test. The scenarios constructed by risk managers are unlikely to have captured the astounding scale and speed of the Covid-19 disruption, for which there was no historical parallel.

He suggests an extreme solution: “Maybe the easiest way is to assume none of the strategies work and everything is correlated. So no matter how you try to diversify, it’s not going to work. In that scenario, what’s your underperformance? How bad can it get? That’s what we’re doing to try to get a gauge of what the so-called worst case might be.”

This approach is different from how AllianceBernstein usually designs stress tests – which is to incorporate the kind of asset correlations and volatility seen in previous crises.

### Creating a playbook

Still, no matter how well-designed, stress tests cannot guarantee a stress-free experience when markets turn south or investors get spooked. To prepare for such situations, Chin suggests another creative solution: risk managers and the investment team should design a “playbook” spelling out what should be done when the worst happens.

For many products, AllianceBernstein did not have these playbooks ready in time to use during the Covid-19 crisis. And Chin does not expect to have perfect playbooks for future crisis events either. “We are developing general frameworks for how to respond to a crisis – what types of assets to sell, minimum liquid requirements in the fund, which teams should make key decisions, valuation policies etcetera,” he says.

He compares it to having a fire safety plan and knowing what things to take and the best routes for escape if there is a blaze. “If you generally know what you need to do, you’ll have a better shot at surviving,” he says.

AllianceBernstein, which manages $542 billion in assets, is currently determining the right minimum level of cash and other liquid assets for its funds. Different funds will have different liquidity buffers, depending on their investment objectives and risk profiles.

The two main considerations in setting the levels are how quickly assets in the portfolio can be sold and how big redemptions are likely to be. The minimum level of cash and liquid assets for a portfolio of investment-grade bonds that can be sold easily will be lower than for a portfolio that contains securitised products. Redemption expectations will depend on the investor mix. Short-term market moves during a crisis tend to influence retail clients more than institutional investors, Chin notes.

By modelling liquidity and redemptions, it should be possible to determine the minimum level of cash and liquid assets required to meet redemptions in a stressed scenario without fire sales, with a certain confidence level. “The parameters will be unique to funds and strategies, but that’s the framework we’re using,” says Chin.

The final playbooks from AllianceBernstein may specify what actions should be taken to maintain this liquidity buffer when certain thresholds are reached. For instance, the thresholds could be bid/ask spreads or trading volumes that signal a fall in liquidity, and the playbook could say which securities should be sold first in such a scenario.

Chin explains that portfolio managers may be reluctant to sell less liquid assets that they see as good-value investments. But at the beginning of a crisis, he says, managers should sell those securities first so that they are not forced to sell them later on at more distressed prices.

“If you don’t have that playbook, you’d say, ‘This is a great investment, I’ve got to hold on to these’. And then a week later, you’re in deep, deep trouble because now you can’t sell anything at all.”

In another example, a credit fund could receive a flood of redemption requests. In normal times, the portfolio manager would give the investors cash, but in a stressed market Chin suggests keeping the cash and selling other assets in the fund “pro rata” so that the fund retains the same proportions of different assets.

“This maintains the risk exposures and the liquidity profile of the fund and allows the fund to be well-positioned for further shocks on the markets,” Chin says. “It sounds obvious in hindsight, right? But at the time, you don’t do it, because you think, ‘Why would I waste all my assets? I’ll give them cash and then let these assets go up?’. They might not go up.”

### Room for improvement

The tactics listed in the playbook need to be backed by strong modelling. Chin suggests some ways to improve stress-testing. One is to adapt it to the current environment. For example, AllianceBernstein ran additional stress tests in March to account for what Chin calls a “global synchronised recession”. The scenarios included a simultaneous blow from the pandemic to both the real estate and retail sectors.

The impromptu stress tests gave risk managers “a sense of the potential further damage” to the economy and financial markets. As result, the firm has been more cautious in adding risk to some of the worst-hit sectors, such as real estate, retail and transportation.

This sort of on-the-fly stress-testing is unusual in the funds industry. According to the Risk.net survey, most firms review and update their scenarios only on a quarterly or annual basis. And just 21% of them run stress tests daily.

Another improvement would be a better understanding of the second- and third-order effects of a crisis – for instance, how much clients are likely to redeem in a given scenario, based on their profile, leverage and portfolio positioning.

Chin gives an example: “Let’s say you have a large client base in Asia. If there’s a big crisis in Asia and equity markets are down, what should happen? So people then need to cover their losses. As they cover their losses, they take money out of all the strategies. Even though you might not be impacted directly in the beginning because you’re not invested in Asia or in equities, eventually people will take money out of your European or fixed income funds because they need to fulfil margin requirements for the other parts of the portfolio.”

This was not a significant issue during the Covid-19 crisis, partly because the market reaction played out too quickly for many investors to react.

In Europe, [redemption modelling](https://www.risk.net/investing/risk-management/7503006/funds-try-to-predict-behaviour-of-mystery-investors) will become compulsory for fund managers from September 30 as part of a new liquidity stress-testing regime.

And just creating a sufficiently severe stress scenario is not enough, Chin argues. The next step is to assign a probability to it.

“If you believe the probability is 1%, maybe you’re willing to tolerate that. But if you think it’s 5% or 10%, maybe you’re not okay with that,” he says.

But he adds: “I don’t have a good answer for how you determine the probability of those bad events. And without that, it’s hard to know how forceful I need to be on incorporating that stress test into the portfolio.”

That problem will take even more creative thinking to solve.
