> _Some states won’t have adopted directive before June, making rule-imposition difficult, say lawyers_

With less than a month to go until the secondMarkets in Financial Instruments Directive comes into force, many of the European Union’s member states have not fully transposed the directives into national law and some – including Spain and Poland – will not have done so until well into 2018. That could make enforcement of the directive incredibly problematic for national competent authorities, say lawyers.

Mifid II is a revamp of Mifid I, and brings with it a variety of new rules – including the creation of organised trading facilities, position limits on commodity derivatives, transparency requirements for equity and non-equity instruments, transaction reporting obligations and the harmonisation of treatment for third-country firms. NCAs, which are tasked with granting OTF status, creating and enforcing the position limits regime, ensuring reporting obligations are adhered to and overseeing a variety of other provisions, will not have the authority to do so, say lawyers.

“If the directive hasn’t been transposed into national law then the regulator hasn’t got legal authority to say yes or no to all sorts of requests, including organised trading facility applications and all the subsidiary requirements, such as pre-and post-trade transparency waivers,” says Tim Cant, counsel in the financial regulation practice of law firm Ashurst.

The Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation deals mainly with trade transparency issues and, being a European regulation, automatically becomes part of each member state’s law from January 3. Mifid II, however, is a directive, which must go through a process in which it becomes national law implemented by each state’s government. In some cases that process is straightforward, but in others it can be a long, drawn-out affair.

According to the European Commission’s [latest update](https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/mifid-ii-directive-transposition-status_en) on October 6, as many as 18 member states had not yet fully transposed. Of the governments of those member states contacted by Risk.net, Slovakia has now fully transposed, Belgium hopes to transpose in the coming days, and Estonia is hopeful to have the bill passed before January 3. The Dutch finance ministry confirmed the bill that transposes Mifid II into national law has been adopted by the Second Chamber of the country’s parliament but it is now with the Senate, which must approve the bill. In an email to Risk.net, the finance ministry was unable to confirm if the bill would be passed by January 3.

In Poland, however, an act to transpose Mifid II is still in the draft stages. A representative of the Polish finance ministry says the act – and so Mifid II – will not come into force until March or April of next year. On December 1, the Spanish government approved a draft law, which is now being reviewed by its advisory board. The draft law is then sent to the parliament for discussion and approval. Given the current distribution of political parties in the parliament, lawyers believe approval will not happen before June 2018. Sweden has adopted all of the provisions of Mifid II apart from some elements of Article 3.2, which covers rules for insurance mediators. The country’s finance ministry says the rest of the directive will be enforceable from January 3, and it hopes to have transposed the remaining element of Mifid II by June 2018.

Offering firms in those jurisdictions extra time to implement internal procedural, IT and business structures, could have implications for the wider market, say lawyers and market participants. Firms could take advantage of the fact that some NCAs will essentially be incapable of enforcing the rules, for some months after those rules become binding in other jurisdictions. One lawyer gives the example of an organisation headquartered in the UK – where Mifid II has been fully transposed – but with operations in Spain.

“If you were an enterprising broker-dealer with a Spanish outpost you could do more trading through that outpost and maybe not be subject to the same type of rules for some time,” he says.

That’s not to say jurisdictions that have not transposed will see an upswing in activity. Artur Zur, chief executive of the Warsaw Commodities Exchange, points out Mifid II brings with it a new level of transparency that should attract greater market participation.

“For foreign investors it would be much better if these regulations were imposed from January 3,” he says. “It makes them feel safe in markets that might be new to them.”

The deadline for transposition was set in July 2014 for July 3, 2017, giving member states three years to transpose the directive. Those member states that have not yet fully transposed the directive face infringement proceedings ranging from formal notifications to referrals to the European Court of Justice. Markus Ferber, the European Parliament’s rapporteur for Mifid II, says the transposition record is “shockingly poor given the imminent entry into force of Mifid II”.

He says the commission needs to do everything in its powers to make sure “there is a swift and comprehensive implementation of Mifid II in all EU member states”.

In a letter to European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis, dated December 6, Ferber asks for an update on the current state of Mifid II transposition and the likelihood that the directive will not be transposed by all member states come January 3. Ferber also asks for clarity over actions the commission tends to take if that is not the case.

There could be a quick way to get around the lack of transposition, say lawyers. An NCA could acknowledge that Mifid II is not national law and claim discretion under national legislation to request market participants to act within the strictures of Mifid II anyway. But again, that would not be enforceable, and anything considered a breach of the rules may well come under judicial review – depending on the jurisdiction. Ashurst’s Cant says NCAs in those jurisdictions may be wary of where their authority begins and ends.

“Without any national transposition, as a national competent authority I would be quite nervous about trying to impose rules on issues such as position limits,” says Cant. “They have no legal force.”

Updated, December 8, 2017: This article was updated to reflect that Sweden has fully transposed Mifid II into national law, apart from Article 3.2. The rest of the directive will be enforceable in the country from January 3, according to a legal adviser in the Swedish ministry of finance.
