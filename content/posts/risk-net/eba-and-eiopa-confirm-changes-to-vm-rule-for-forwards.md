European regulators have confirmed they are amending a rule that requires buy-side firms to post and collect variation margin on certain foreign exchange forwards from January 3 next year, in a fresh sign that the unpopular requirement will be permanently shelved.

Although the rule is part of a global push to margin most non-cleared derivatives, Europe is currently the only jurisdiction that applies it to buy-side users of physically settled currency forwards – a controversial stance because the products are widely used by smaller firms. Some users have threatened to [avoid European dealers](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5313881/fx-forwards-users-drop-eu-banks-over-margin-rule) after the rule takes effect.

In short emailed statements, two of Europe’s three technical rule-writing bodies today confirmed they are making changes to the text. Last week, the Council of the European Union suggested only banks should comply with the rule.

“To achieve international alignment, the European Supervisory Authorities are currently working on an amendment of the regulatory technical standard (RTS),” said spokespeople for the European Banking Authority and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, two of the three ESAs. A spokesperson for the European Securities and Markets Authority – the third ESA – declined to comment.

The RTS in question was issued in October 2016 to postpone the start of the regime for forwards. While other products became subject to the margining regime in March this year, physically settled forwards were carved out because of problems defining them in different EU member states.

The ESAs would not comment on their planned changes, but sources speculate they could be extending the existing delay until amendments to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, known as the Emir review, come into force. Because Emir is a so-called ‘level 1’ text, it could strike the requirement out altogether – as technical bodies, the ESAs can only suggest delays.

[Risk.net revealed](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5359331/eu-proposals-feed-hopes-of-fx-forward-vm-relief) on Friday that the Council of the EU’s compromise proposal for the Emir review suggested only applying the variation margin requirement “for transactions concluded between credit institutions”.

To kill off the rule, the council’s proposal would have to survive three-way negotiations with the European Commission and European Parliament, which will not conclude this year.

A new delay from the ESAs would also need to be approved by the EC before it could come into force, which may not be possible before the rules kick in on January 3.

“The timeline is challenging, and it will be interesting to see what framework can be proposed that achieves the desired outcome,” says a regulatory expert at one European bank.

Given the Council of the EU’s stance, the ESAs’ announcement may make national regulators such as the UK’s Prudential Regulation Authority more comfortable temporarily turning a blind eye to breaches of the rule after it takes effect next year – the assumption being that the rule will ultimately be dropped, or a new postponement agreed.

“It’s not enough for the PRA or any individual supervisory authority to say: ‘We agree with you’. They need to be saying: ‘We agree with you and we know it’s happening at the European level’, or it needs to come from Europe directly,” says a derivatives partner at one international law firm.

“My assumption is we will see an announcement at the European level and we will see something at an individual supervisory authority level. It will be forbearance on enforcement in anticipation of the rules being changed,” the partner adds.

The bank regulatory expert shares this view: “Overall, I think that the ESAs’ objective is to come out with a formulation that gives comfort to domestic regulators.”

In Emir, financial entities were subject to variation margin for new non-cleared swaps and forwards trades from March 1. However, the definition of a physically settled forward is not uniform across EU member states. This problem will be remedied when the review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive comes into force on January 3.

To create a level playing field, the October 2016 RTS delayed the starting date of variation margining for these instruments until the earlier of the entry into force of Mifid II or December 31, 2018.
