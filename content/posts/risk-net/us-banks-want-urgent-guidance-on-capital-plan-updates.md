> _Call for Fed to provide Covid scenarios by start of September, not in fourth quarter_

US banks want guidance as quickly as possible on the method and timing for the resubmission of 2020 capital plans, with some urging regulators to kick off the process in early September. Bankers are hoping for further announcements imminently, citing the dangers of fresh complications if the start date is delayed into the fourth quarter.

“The banks are worried about the uncertainty, they don’t want this uncertainty to continue until the end of the year,” an industry source says.

The deadline for banks to submit their original capital plans as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) was April 6, based on stress test scenarios the US Federal Reserve published in February.

But the coronavirus pandemic led to a combination of market chaos, dismal economic forecasts, dramatic Fed interventions and heavy corporate drawdowns of bank credit lines from mid-March onward. These events expanded balance sheets and increased risks, rendering the assumptions of scenarios published in February obsolete.

That forced the Fed to add a set of [sensitivity analyses](https://www.risk.net/investing/regulation/7649621/how-the-feds-covid-stress-test-got-stuck-in-the-middle) to the CCAR exercise, for which results have so far only been published in aggregate. The regulator has indicated that it will provide banks with a set of new scenarios integrating the possible impact of coronavirus lockdowns on their portfolios, to feed into banks’ amended capital plans.

The sector fears a longer resubmission schedule for those plans increases the risk the process will be outpaced by events, as happened with the original 2020 CCAR. Bankers want to know how the Fed will respond if, once again, there are significant developments between the release of the scenarios and the finalisation of new capital plans.

The industry source explains: “If the Fed releases the scenarios in early September, after the Labor Day weekend, and we have a serious second wave of Covid-19 and the government approves another stimulus package, how will the Fed incorporate these events? Suppose we have another QE occurring in October and a massive increase of reserves in the system, firms drawing down again on credit lines, and so forth?”

There are further questions on what balance sheet date will be used for the test. The Fed usually receives quarterly data from firms six to eight weeks after the end of the quarter, but a senior Fed official indicates the regulator may choose an off-calendar date.

The sector’s preferred outcome would be a supervisory analysis based on second-quarter balance sheets, because if third-quarter balance sheets were used, then the scenarios would not be available until the fourth quarter.

“A June 30 balance sheet would mean the scenarios would be available right after Labor Day weekend [September 7],” the industry source says. The Fed has said capital plans should be resubmitted within 45 days of the new scenarios being released, so using a second-quarter balance sheet would allow banks to wrap up the process by mid-October.

A senior Fed official, however, says the scenarios may not be issued until the fourth quarter.

### Expanded buffers
The sector is also awaiting clarification on whether the new capital plans will be based on a full stress test or another ad hoc sensitivity analysis. Bankers suspect a longer timeline would involve the Fed opting for a full rerun of CCAR, rather than a quicker add-on process.

“The banking sector would like the simplest and quickest runs, because anything like running a CCAR all over again will be very expensive and an enormous undertaking,” says Karen Petrou, managing partner at consultancy Federal Financial Analytics.

As well as being longer and more operationally challenging, a fresh stress test would have other implications, according to Jeremy Kress, assistant professor of business law at the University of Michigan. He thinks the full results would have to be published (as with CCAR), and there would then be an expectation that the Fed would use those results to amend banks’ stress capital buffers (SCB).

The SCB, introduced this year for the first time, is currently due to be [finalised](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7649206/three-us-banks-face-stress-capital-buffer-add-ons) for banks by October 1, based on the maximum capital depletion they suffered in the severely adverse scenario for the original CCAR. The coronavirus sensitivity analyses showed much [higher losses](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7568806/feds-covid-scenarios-far-harsher-than-latest-stress-tests) than CCAR, but did not feed into the SCB.

Kress points out that, in the [report](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2020-sensitivity-analysis-20200625.pdf) publishing the results of the sensitivity analyses on June 25, the Fed stated that the impact of coronavirus “could have a material effect on each firm’s risk profile and financial condition and require updated capital plans”.

He believes this is a deliberate reference to a phrase in the Fed’s [final SCB rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/03/18/2020-04838/regulations-q-y-and-yy-regulatory-capital-capital-plan-and-stress-test-rules#p-147) in March 2020, which states that if there is any material change in a firm’s risk profile, “the firm would be required to resubmit its capital plan and the Board may determine to recalculate the stress capital buffer requirement based on the resubmitted capital plan”.

In his view, this suggests the Fed is preparing the ground for amendments to the SCB once capital plans are resubmitted.

The industry source also expects a full stress test could result in a higher SCB, and that this could pressurise banks to strengthen capital ratios by cutting exposures or being forced to raise fresh capital in difficult market conditions. This conflicts with efforts by regulators to [ease](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7522166/banks-fear-time-limit-on-fed-leverage-ratio-reprieve) prudential requirements to make it easier for banks to finance the economy during the coronavirus crisis, and might instead intensify the downward swing of the economy.

“It is hard to imagine a situation in which re-running a full CCAR would not lead to higher buffers, which in turn will be procyclical and cause some banks to have their lending restricted,” the industry source says.

No matter what route the Fed takes, above all the sector is calling on it to telegraph its intentions in a clear and timely way, to allow the sector and markets room to adjust.

If the SCB is raised, the industry source says banks will need time to increase their capital, for instance via retained earnings. Banks would also prefer a clearer explanation of the rubric and reasoning behind coronavirus scenarios, underpinned by thorough communication of the Fed’s thinking and assumptions.

“The important thing is that, whatever balance sheet date is used, the firms know as soon as possible. The rules need to be clear, to avoid surprises and help us plan – it’s a lot about process,” says the industry source.

Fed vice-chair of supervision Randal Quarles is due to give a speech at the Exchequer Club of Washington today (July 7). The topic is a discussion of a recent Financial Stability Board [report](https://www.fsb.org/2020/06/evaluation-of-the-effects-of-too-big-to-fail-reforms-consultation-report/) on too-big-to-fail banks, but the audience of financial sector participants may also ask him to touch on the process for resubmitting capital plans.
