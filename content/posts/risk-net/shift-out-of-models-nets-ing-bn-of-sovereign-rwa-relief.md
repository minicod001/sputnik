Dutch lender ING reduced risk-weighted assets (RWAs) by 4% over the three months to end-June, largely as a result of switching to the regulator-set standardised approach for calculating the riskiness of its government debt holdings.

The bank said the change shaved €8.3 billion ($9.8 billion) off its credit RWAs, netting it a regulatory capital saving of some €664 million.

Regulatory filings show that at end-June, the bank had €11.2 billion of RWAs for sovereign exposures, of which 15% were calculated under the standardised approach, and the remainder under the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach. Total sovereign exposures, after accounting for credit risk-mitigation measures, totalled €203.9 billion, meaning the portfolio had an overall risk-weight of 5.5%. ING did not publish data on sovereign RWAs as of end-March.

Further RWA reductions were achieved thanks to the Capital Requirements Regulation [‘quick fix’](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7660686/coronavirus-crisis-sours-eu8bn-of-santanders-loans) passed by the European Union in June, worth around €2.9 billion.

Another €3.5 billion was saved through a “capital management action related to contractual cashflow maturities for certain lending products”.

There reductions were offset somewhat by a €6.6 billion add-on to account for the supervisory impact of the European Central Bank’s targeted review of internal models (Trim).

In contrast to credit RWAs, market RWAs swelled 5% to €10.6 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the spike in volatility witnessed early in Q2. Operational RWAs fell around 2% to €37.1 billion following updates to the advanced measurement approach model used to calculate these

### What is it?

Basel Committee rules allow credit risk capital to be calculated using standardised and IRB approaches.

Under the standardised approach, credit exposures are assessed using standard industry-wide risk weightings.

There are two IRB approaches. Foundation IRB (F-IRB) allows banks to provide their own estimates of the probabilities of default of their credit exposures, but uses regulator-set schema for other risk components, such as loss-given default measures, to generate the ultimate RWA amount. The advanced IRB (A-IRB) approach uses banks’ own data, internal models and conversion factors to calculate RWAs.

### Why it matters

Certain exposures typically attract a lower risk-weighting under the standardised approach than when subjected to banks’ own internal models. The Q2 data shows that of the €2.2 billion of sovereign exposures under the standardised approach at ING, 24% attracted a zero risk-weighting, meaning no regulatory capital had to be held against them at all.

Though most of the bank’s IRB-assessed sovereign exposures were also assigned the lowest risk-weight band, these were not zero-weighted, and attracted €6.1 billion of RWAs. Therefore, it’s more capital efficient to put low-risk government bond portfolios under the standardised approach if possible.

The switcheroo may have offset the latest round of [Trim](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7408551/model-review-adds-eu13bn-to-ings-rwas) effects to RWAs, but it represents a one-off effect. ING may find it harder to mitigate further inflation of its credit RWAs in the coming quarters, unless it can shunt other exposures under the standardised approach.
