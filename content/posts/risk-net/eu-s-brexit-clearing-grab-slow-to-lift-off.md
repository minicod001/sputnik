The migration of cleared swaps from UK central counterparties to EU counterparts has only made slow and immaterial progress, according to clearing members speaking during a virtual conference.

“Eurex does seem to be making some headway in volumes … but I think if you look at numbers directly, at rates clearing volumes at LCH and Eurex, material risk transferred between the two CCPs hasn’t really played out yet, particularly for the longer-dated portfolios,” said Farida El-Gammal, global clearing product development at JP Morgan.

Speaking at the conference, which was hosted by the Futures Industry Association on July 8, El-Gammal added that there had been a few high-profile [portfolio transfers](https://www.risk.net/our-take/5831041/clearing-up-deutsches-swaps-shift) from London’s LCH to Germany-based Eurex, and there is “a recognition in the industry that contingency access is a good thing”.

Central clearing has been a major flashpoint between EU and UK lawmakers following the UK decision to leave the bloc in 2016, as many European firms clear their trades at UK clearing houses. Some EU politicians have [expressed](https://www.risk.net/regulation/emir/2463223/not-so-fast-francois-eu-clearing-land-grab-complex) a desire to pry the business away from UK CCPs, particularly the clearing of euro-denominated interest rate swaps, which are predominantly cleared at LCH.

Under the EU’s [European Market Infrastructure Regulation](https://www.risk.net/topics/emir), European firms can only be clearing members to EU CCPs or those in jurisdictions recognised as equivalent. Emir also requires all European-domiciled derivatives users to clear certain interest rate swaps and credit derivatives on EU or equivalent third-country CCPs.

EU legislators have [long dangled](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6003051/eu-clients-face-axe-from-uk-ccps) the threat of UK CCPs not being granted [equivalence](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7404916/the-uk-path-to-eu-equivalence-detente-or-detour). If UK CCPs are not granted [equivalence](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7404916/the-uk-path-to-eu-equivalence-detente-or-detour) before the end of a transition period that is due to expire on December 31, 2020, EU financial firms will be unable to provide clearing services at UK CCPs.

Eurex Clearing is expected to be the largest beneficiary of LCH being off-limits for EU clearing members, and has already been able to [snatch](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5839496/lch-eurex-basis-falls-80-as-insurers-head-to-frankfurt) some business away from LCH. In November 2019, Eurex announced DekaBank had been able to transfer its swap book from LCH to Eurex Clearing in a single day.

But panellists from two clearing banks said clients haven’t rushed for the doors and have largely been considering switching as a contingency measure.

“We have access to all relevant venues in Europe to allow clients to move business, but in the end it is the clients themselves who decide whether or not they will be moving business,” said Robbert Booij, chief executive for European clearing at ABN Amro, also speaking at the conference. “We do see an increase in clients, if we talk about euro clearing, who want to set up an account to move business from LCH should it be required. They are not shifting positions very rapidly and that is probably also due to availability of products, currency pairs and liquidity.”

### Too sticky
Panellists blamed the steep costs involved in transferring positions for making it undesirable to switch. For example, European firms may find they [take a loss](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5311916/dislocation-policy-lch-exodus-risks-ccp-basis-blow-out) from closing their existing swaps at LCH at current market values.

JP Morgan’s El-Gammal said long-dated interest rates swaps have proven relatively “sticky”, and dealers have kept those in LCH.

“It is not just as easy as a forklift, getting your risk and portfolio from one CCP and forklifting it to another,” said El-Gammal. “You have to close out your positions on LCH by putting on an equal and offsetting trade – flatten that position – and then you open that position at a second CCP, and you do that at market value, so it is not a P&L-neutral transaction. It will cost whoever undertakes this.”

There is also a risk that firms transferring swaps from LCH to Eurex lose out if a basis between LCH and Eurex – reflecting the cost for dealers to clear at two different CCPs – moves against the firm while they are transferring.

El-Gammal added that clients also benefit from netting and margin efficiencies by having their positions all in LCH, especially as LCH clears a vast set of interest rate swaps in many different currencies.

“If you have Hong Kong or Canadian dollar multi-rates portfolios, at that point you are going to get into the territory of splitting your netting sets between the two CCPs, and again, is that the right answer for you?” asked El-Gammal.

According to their web pages, Eurex offers clearing of interest rate swaps in nine currencies, whereas LCH offers clearing in 26.

The disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic in Europe has also delayed firms moving their positions, as they don’t want the increased costs, nor the operational burden, of doing so during a crisis.

“The Covid-19 [pandemic] has made it worse [to transfer], and that is also understandable because firms are busy managing their risk, and they are not really focusing on splitting positions at the minute because that creates inefficient portfolios,” said ABN Amro’s Booij. “The result is also an increase in margin and therefore higher risk for the end-client.”

### An own goal?
Booij pointed out that, if European firms are cut off from UK CCPs, then it doesn’t necessarily mean the business will move out of London.

EU clearing firms could still provide clearing services to UK CCPs if they set up UK subsidiaries and onboard their European clients. However, it would be costly for European banks to offer that service due to the EU bank capital law – the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) – which increases the risk-weight applied to exposures to non-equivalent third-country clearing houses versus those that are in the EU or deemed equivalent.

Exposures to so-called qualifying CCPs can benefit from a 2% risk-weight, whereas exposures to those CCPs deemed not to be equivalent range from 20% to 150%, depending on the CCP’s credit rating.

Although the UK subsidiary of the EU firm that acts as a clearing member in the UK wouldn’t face those high capital charges, its parent entity in the EU would, as the subsidiary would be [consolidated](https://www.risk.net/regulation/6168446/brexit-set-to-jack-up-banks-capital-costs) into the parent company for group capital reporting.

“At group level, for European firms – not just ABN Amro, these are all European firms – this would trigger a very significant capital increase, as an exposure to non-qualified CCPs receives a very punitive capital increase in EU legislation,” said Booij. “So this forces European firms to terminate access to EU markets for their clients, unless those European firms are willing to absorb the very punitive capital increases.”

The undesirable economics of clearing with EU banks could lead to European non-bank clients setting up UK subsidiaries to clear through non-EU CCP members in London. Non-EU clearing members would not be subject to the EU clearing obligation, and would not suffer the CRR capital penalty when providing services on UK CCPs. European non-banks that don’t have prudential capital requirements would also not need to worry about the punitive capital charges arising from a UK subsidiary clearing on a non-equivalent CCP. The loss of business for EU27 clearing members is surely not an outcome that policymakers would want, Booij suggested.

“European firms would be severely impacted in the case of no equivalence,” he said. “It would actually mean European end-clients could still access European markets using UK and US banks, and I think this is a serious disruption to the level playing field that should be considered.”

### Against the clock
There is now only a short amount of time before CCPs and clearing members reach the Brexit cliff edge. Although the transition period ends on December 31 this year, UK CCPs must give at least [three months’ notice](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5904966/time-running-out-for-eu-brexit-temporary-permissions-regime) to off-board clearing members, meaning the notice must come at the end of September.

“We are not deaf to the time constraints, and we plan to make our intentions known so we do not leave it to the last moment,” said Andrea Beltramello, who works in the cabinet of Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission executive vice-president for financial services.

When the threat of a no-deal Brexit loomed in the past, the EC has granted UK CCPs [temporary equivalence](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7000401/fca-chief-calls-for-eu-to-extend-brexit-clearing-exemption) to avoid the anticipated disruption. Beltramello effectively acknowledged that the shift of clearing away from London had been slow, saying the last [temporary equivalence](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7000401/fca-chief-calls-for-eu-to-extend-brexit-clearing-exemption) decision – which the EC granted in December last year for 12 months – was given due to the insufficient progress of EU firms in preparing for a no-deal Brexit.

“We have identified this as a systemic risk for a long time, and this is why in September 2018 we granted temporary equivalence, because we thought this was an issue that needed to be addressed,” said Beltramello. “But then at the end of last year, and regrettably, we saw that the risk to financial stability had not been fully removed yet, because we considered the industry had not made sufficient preparations for a no-deal Brexit in case there was one.”

The EC, however, has signalled a desire to assess whether UK CCPs are equivalent under a new beefed-up version of Emir, which would give EU regulators supervisory powers over third-country CCPs regarded as systemically important to Europe.

“Now, by the time the equivalence decision expires at the end of this year … we expect that these implementing rules would be fully in place and therefore they would let us supervise third-country CCPs, including systemic third-country CCPs,” said Beltramello. “So in a way, everything is going according to plan.”

The [new Emir equivalence](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7245111/clearing-experts-fear-tough-ec-stance-on-emir-22) rules have not yet been finalised. A consultation run by the EC closes for industry responses today (July 9), after which the EC will finalise the delegated act. It must then be approved by the European Parliament and Council of the EU through a non-objection process – which is unlikely to take less than two months, even on a fast-track timetable.

Julien Jardelot, head of government relations and strategy at the London Stock Exchange Group, which has a majority stake in LCH, said there is very little time for LCH to submit an application for equivalence under this new set of rules after their completion.

“The challenge we face is the timing, especially if you look at [when] the delegated acts need to be finalised,” he said. “Even with a non-objection procedure that is completely reduced, you are still talking about two months, including the famous August month, which is basically dead in a lot of our companies and in the Commission. So I think it is important for us to have clarity as early as possible.
