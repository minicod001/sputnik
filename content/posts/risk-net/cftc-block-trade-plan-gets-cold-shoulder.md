{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Industry divided over swaps reform proposal, and advisory committee casts doubt on need for it_{{< /quote >}}

A Commodity Futures Trading Commission plan to revise US rules for block trades in swaps has drawn a cool response from the industry, with participants at an advisory committee providing feedback that undermines some of the justification for the proposal.

Tradeweb and Bloomberg swap execution facilities (Sefs), which account for more than 75% of all interest rate swap block trades on-venue, both told a meeting of the CFTC’s market risk advisory committee (MRAC) on July 21 that their markets had continued to function well even in the face of extreme volatility caused by the Covid-19 crisis in March. Both venues registered record volumes of block trades, although price dispersion was high.

“The platform held up very well, particularly in its ability to allow participants to move sizeable amounts of risk in a time of crisis,” Tradeweb’s head of rates products and strategy, Elisabeth Kirby, told the MRAC, noting that market participants appeared willing to sacrifice price sensitivity for the ability to move risk quickly.

This comes after a hesitant response from market participants to the CFTC’s consultation on block trades, which was published on February 20. While there is some support for more lenient block trade rules in relatively illiquid markets such as commodity derivatives or complex products, there are also objections to possible reductions in transparency in comparatively liquid markets such as interest rate swaps (IRS).

The proposal would raise the threshold for trades to be eligible for an exemption from real-time public reporting of the price and size of a transaction – known as post-trade transparency. Trades that would fall into the largest 33% by notional amount based on the previous full year of data would be considered eligible as block trades, down from 50% at present.

However, the CFTC’s division of market oversight (DMO) proposed refining the categorisation of swaps used to make this notional amount calculation, which could result in more trades meeting the threshold in certain specific products. There are five broad categories under the current rules (interest rates; equity; credit; FX; and other commodity), with some sub-divisions in each category.

For instance, the DMO wants to see better subdivision of IRS based on the reference currency of the swap, reflecting different liquidity levels in dollar products compared with non-US currencies. Credit derivatives would be divided up into seven distinct products, replacing the current three sub-categories that are based purely on the credit spread levels of the instrument. Some commodity swaps categories would all be considered block trades, due to low trade counts for those products.

John Roberts, research analyst in the office of chief economist at the CFTC, told the open meeting on February 20 that these revisions would “better target those large trades that merit block treatment”.

In addition, the delay in reporting requirements for block trades would be harmonised at 48 hours, replacing the current range of deferrals that depend on the nature of the trade. Roberts said this would “give market participants more time to place a hedge position”.

The shortest current deferral, for cleared swaps that are executed on-venue and involve at least one swap dealer or major swap participant as a counterparty, is just 15 minutes, while the longest is 24 hours.

### The long and the short of it

There are noticeably divergent views in the industry on the proposed universal 48-hour deferral for block trades. In the responses to the consultation, some end-users argued for longer delays for reporting. The American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) expressed its preference for a 15-day delay or, failing that, tailored relief for illiquid products or those involving complex risk.

By contrast, other respondents considered 48 hours to be unnecessarily long for some products. Some buy-side firms and non-bank liquidity providers were concerned that the blanket deferral would harm post-trade transparency, liquidity, risk management and fair competition in the swaps market.

“The intent of the public reporting requirement in Dodd Frank was to enhance price discovery in the swaps market. If the delay is too long, by the time the market gets information about the trade, the information is likely to be stale and essentially meaningless,” says Richard Shilts, senior policy adviser at law firm Steptoe and a former director of the DMO.

Fund manager Vanguard, in its comment letter, said although it was in favour of longer delays in principle, it was concerned the proposals were not accompanied by supporting data, demonstrating that the appropriate balance was struck between the CFTC’s policy goals of market transparency and market liquidity for Sefs.

“No data has been provided to support change to either or both of the size or delay. Commenting is also compromised as the Commission is seeking a simultaneous change in both the block sizes and the reporting delay, as a change in one necessarily impacts the other,” the Vanguard letter noted.

The text of the draft rule itself notes that 90% of trades are hedged by end of day, so the justification for 48-hour deferrals across the board is unclear.

Julian Hammar, partner at law firm Fisher Boyles, says: “For swaps like kerosene, which is obviously going to be a fairly illiquid product, it may take some time to hedge, so 48 hours may be fine in that case. But if it’s a plain vanilla interest rate swap that is highly liquid, then I’m not sure it really makes sense to have such a lengthy delay for block trade reporting of it.”

Hammar adds that at least some block trades are conducted between swaps dealers. Under the existing rule, such trades would most likely end up in the 15-minute delay category. It is unclear why a longer delay to reporting would be necessary or desirable, he says.

“I understand you don’t want to pass along costs to commercial end-users, [but] I’m not certain if the transaction is between two dealers that it makes sense to have the longer delay, because the statute is clear that this data should be reported as soon as technologically practicable,” says Hammar.

A further question raised by market participants is why the CFTC has not taken the opportunity to align its deferral regime with that of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has a standard 24-hour delay to reporting for block trades.

“It’s one of the few instances where the two Commissions agreed to disagree,” says Matthew Kulkin, a partner at Steptoe and former head of the CFTC’s division of swap dealer oversight until November 2019. “The rules were adopted early in the Dodd-Frank implementation process, where the CFTC went first and the SEC came up with its own approach. Now, years later, the CFTC is reconsidering its approach and proposing a delay that is even longer than the SEC’s.”

### Hard to get it right

There was a general consensus among industry representatives at the July 21 MRAC that some of the existing block trade thresholds are too high. BlackRock, Citi, Vanguard and consultancy Chatham Financial all pointed out that participants had sometimes been forced to break up relatively large swaps trades during the March volatility, to minimise market impact because they were not eligible as block trades.

“We did have some real issues getting efficient execution for our clients during some of the more volatile periods…, specifically the trades just under block sizes,” said Eileen Kiely, deputy head of counterparty and concentration risk at BlackRock.

But coming up with the right alternative thresholds is beset with difficulties, notes Kulkin.

“One, it can be very challenging to set thresholds, and two it can be just as challenging – if not more challenging – to have a regime in place that allows for easily raising or lowering the levels to reflect market dynamics,” Kulkin says.

In a comment [letter](https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISDA-SIFMA-Response-on-Real-Time-Public-Reporting-Block-Thresholds.pdf) on the proposal, dated May 22, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association advocated going beyond the simple one-year reference period for calculating the block trade threshold, instead using dynamic thresholds for each swaps category based on relative liquidity and risk sensitivity data. This would be calibrated to take into account both calm and stressed market conditions, not just the preceding year’s data.

But further refinements of this sort could be difficult for the regulator and industry to manage. Already, the CFTC’s February proposals will substantially increase the complexity of block trade rules.

“Under the current regime, there are 27 swap categories. Under the new proposal, that’s going to go up to 136 categories, so that’s a big difference,” says James Mooney, regulatory consultant at Kaizen Reporting.

### European model?

The DMO also prompted some confusion by suggesting its proposal is designed to enable convergence between the CFTC’s approach and the post-trade transparency rules in the European Union. Commissioner Rostin Behnam specifically asked DMO staff at the February 20 open meeting if they had had contact with the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) about the new CFTC proposal, but was told there had been no such contact.

A source at a non-bank market-maker notes the proposal doesn’t really align the CFTC and EU regimes, because the US uses a reporting cap so that the full size of block trades is not revealed to other market participants, as a way of reducing information leakage. The February proposal retains a modified version of this cap element, which does not exist in Europe.

“If you enter a billion-dollar trade in a 10-year US dollar IRS, when you publicly report that block trade after 15 minutes, it doesn’t show up as a billion dollars on the tape, it shows up as 170 million-plus, so market participants don’t know the true size of the trade. In Europe, it shows up as a billion dollars,” says the non-bank market-maker source.

Steptoe’s Shilts says international alignment on block trade deferrals could become more valuable in the future, but he is not sure it serves much purpose currently, because products themselves are not aligned.

“Generally, the futures contracts actively traded in the US are not identical to those traded overseas, so if you’re doing corn swaps or US Treasury swaps, you most likely lay off [the risk] on futures in the US,” says Shilts. “Or you’re going to trade with swap dealers – even if they’re international – from their US desk.”

The source at the non-bank market-maker also questions why the US would want to align with the EU’s current post-trade transparency regime, which includes deferrals of between 48 hours and four weeks and a broad range of exemptions from real-time reporting. Those rules, contained in the EU’s second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid II), are widely regarded as so complicated they have [failed](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7154086/why-europes-markets-might-need-mifid-iii) to improve market transparency.

Ironically, Esma is now considering reform proposals to simplify Mifid II that could move the European regime [closer](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7649641/improving-mifid-post-trade-transparency-splits-markets) to the CFTC’s existing approach, where more trades are eligible for real-time transparency.

“There’s a general recognition across the entire regulatory community in the EU that the transparency framework under Mifid II is severely flawed and has not achieved any of the intended aims, and that’s why you see the [European] Commission issuing a consultation,” says the source at the non-bank liquidity provider.

Given the limited industry appetite for the mooted changes to the US block trade regime, the regulatory affairs head at a buy-side firm questions how much impetus there will be behind the CFTC’s plan. He suggests much of the groundwork on the proposal may have been done before Heath Tarbert became chairman of the CFTC in July 2019.

“The chairman went out of his way in the [February 20] meeting to highlight that this was one of several elements of the final rule, and that he understood market participants would likely be commenting on it and that he was open to making changes,” says the regulatory affairs head.
