When ABN Amro Clearing sustained a $200 million net loss from New York-based hedge fund Parplus Partners, it contacted its hundreds of clients to explain what had happened, and reassure them all was well.

But as the months rolled by, firms’ curiosity has shifted from what happened in March to what will happen in August.

That’s when the lender will announce the results of a major review of its corporate and investment banking division, which suffered a loss of €575 million ($649.8 million) during the first quarter. The results are being closely watched by investors, but also by the Dutch taxpayer, who – over a decade on from a crisis-era restructuring and bailout – remains ABN’s majority shareholder.

The futures commission merchant’s (FCM) share of the [losses](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7514381/hedge-fund-parplus-said-to-be-source-of-abns-200m-loss), sustained when Parplus was [wrong-footed](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7514381/hedge-fund-parplus-said-to-be-source-of-abns-200m-loss) on an equity volatility strategy, is a serious one for the division. It wiped out almost two years’ worth of net profit and triggered speculation about whether the business could be pared back. It has also raised questions about the value proposition of providing clearing services – and leaves blood in the water for its rivals.

“The CIB business consumes a third of group capital. It’s around 20% of group revenues, but it’s 70% of the risk cost over the past five to seven years,” says Johan Ekblom, an analyst at UBS. “They have this huge volatility and risk cost – be it clearing and commodity finance in Q1, be it diamonds in the last two years, or be it shipping – that causes a disproportional amount of credit losses.”

Some clients are not waiting for the outcome of the review. They are already looking to diversify. Three separate clearing firms tell Risk.net they were approached by clients of ABN Amro in the immediate aftermath of the Parplus default – although they decline to name any potential clients.

ABN itself says the putative exodus is overstated.

Any significant retrenchment would be a dramatic reversal for what has been one of the most consistently profitable units in ABN’s CIB. In 2019 and 2018, ABN Amro Clearing reported net profits of €112 million and €119 million respectively, and has regularly delivered double-digit returns on equity, topping 10% every year since 2014 and hitting 22.5% in a volatile 2018 – well above the 15% ROE most FCMs strive for.

Exiting the clearing business isn’t necessarily the most judicious route, say some.

“I think ABN Amro will want to lower the risk profile of the clearing business,” says Jon Peace, European banks analyst at Credit Suisse, but adds: “There isn’t a massive balance sheet cost associated with the clearing business. I think it might be more a case of some management or control changes, rather than any big exit costs.”

And as one of the largest global clearers to proprietary trading firms, any changes to ABN’s business model would have major ramifications for the futures industry more broadly. The bank’s footprint among these clients, particularly with Dutch and UK-based futures and options market-makers, is enormous. ABN lays claim to a 20% market share on many major exchanges and a global top-three clearing position by turnover and market share, according to its latest annual report.

But rivals contend this seeming dominance is built on a model they’ve no wish to emulate. Proprietary traders are seen as undesirable clients by some FCMs, who say clearing for them requires the kind of cutthroat pricing and razor-thin margins they can no longer justify.

“They are too risky, too thinly capitalised, are less professional and usually have less of a track record [than hedge fund managers],” says the head of listed derivatives at a large clearing firm.

In the past, interest income from the vast client initial margin pool that came with a big futures market share would also have been a good earner for the bank – but in days of low or negative rates, it is decidedly [less so](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7552511/clearing-banks-feel-pinch-as-rates-turn-negative).

Making matters worse, capital accounting for credit risk under the current exposure method has historically [penalised](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7530856/leverage-ratio-squeeze-hits-options-trades) clients with high notional exposures – causing some FCMs to conclude that clearing for props is simply too balance-sheet-intensive, and not lucrative enough without significant scale.

“Prop shops think they’re above everyone,” says the head of sales at a large clearing bank. “They say: ‘If you can’t give us razor-thin prices and the best terms, we’ll just go to the next person.’ Unfortunately, the world has moved on, and you can’t do that any more because most of the banks that used to be able to do that can’t take you on any more – because of risk metrics, because of governance. It’s a different ball game.”

### Clear cut?

The loss at ABN Amro Clearing certainly puts ABN’s new CEO Robert Swaak in a quandary. Not only does it come at a moment of great uncertainty for Europe’s banks, it appears to vindicate investors who  complained there was too much volatility in returns within the CIB.

Swaak – a career accountant who joined the bank in April from PwC Netherlands – confirmed on a May call with investors that the clearing business was “on the table” as part of the review.

RBS, sometime bedfellow of ABN, this year [took an axe](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7431581/rbs-takes-axe-to-natwest-markets) to its ailing markets business, which last year accounted for 20% of the bank’s capital footprint – despite generating less than 10% of its income. That review resulted in the [closure](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7517576/rbs-exits-listed-derivatives-trading-and-clearing) of the bank’s futures clearing unit – though it was a far smaller player than ABN, and a generator of far lower, less steady returns for the bank.

ABN made a €395 million net loss in 2019 and a restructuring of other parts of the CIB could be costly, making dividend or share buybacks a prospect investors might only enjoy by 2022, according to Ekblom. Potentially selling the clearing business could help fund the restructuring and offer investors an earlier dividend payment.

The European Central Bank has requested that share buy-backs be suspended until at least October 1 to aid banks’ ability to sustain Covid-related losses and support the real economy with lending.

“It’s very likely that with restructuring charges they will report a loss this year,” says Ekblom. “If there is a big CIB restructuring that really is going to happen next year, it’s very possible they won’t make a lot of money next year either. And I guess with the political climate, going to the ECB while not making much money and asking to pay shareholders is not an argument you will win. But if you funded the restructuring costs with a capital gain, you could essentially report a profit, giving you more freedom of distribution.”

Credit Suisse’s Peace believes that it is unlikely there will be a sale of the clearing business.

“The synergies of the clearing division with the rest of the CIB are not great, to be honest,” he says. “However, a number of banks have non-core divisions like ABN Amro Clearing, which sprang up by luck or over time due to historical trends. If non-core businesses like this are reasonably profitable, why not keep running them as a cash cow?”

Other divisions within ABN’s CIB also look more vulnerable. It was in the trade and commodity finance division of the CIB that ABN Amro has been left nursing a potential $225 million loss in relation to loans to oil trading firm Hin Leong.

“I would have thought [the clearing business] is one of the least likely they’re going to get rid of – the reason for that is that it’s a low-RWA business,” says Philip Richards, senior banks analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “I think they’re going to target the riskier elements of the bank and therefore free up the capital position.”

He, for one, sees this as unnecessary: “I don’t think there is any pressure to sell a business to finance their restructuring. I think they can restructure once earnings get back to more normalised levels or just through the capital position of the bank; they don’t need to sell to finance it.”

However, Richards adds: “It’s by no means known – they can easily scale back the clearing side. It’s not a case of ‘they won’t touch that’. I think they might well do.”

“Being majority government owned does alter the risk profile of the bank,” says Peace. “However, I think this scrutiny manifests itself in slower capital returns, rather than the day-to-day management of ABN Amro’s portfolio of businesses. Given that ABN has been reasonably profitable in the past and has above-average capital levels, I don’t think the government will try to micromanage them to the degree of advising them what businesses to restructure.”

JP Morgan analysts have noted in recent research that the clearing business will be aided by [changes](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7530856/leverage-ratio-squeeze-hits-options-trades) to bank capital rules for the calculation of counterparty credit risk, reducing the leverage ratio of the business. This, too, could be weighed as a consideration by the senior leadership team in how to proceed with the division.

The clearing business itself has also made a few changes since the March market meltdown. The bank is understood to be implementing changes to its stress-testing of client exposures – as part of the usual layer of additional margin the bank charges on some positions when its own risk models deem exchange margin to be [too low](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7567431/higher-margins-would-aid-clearing-stability-ice-clear-chief) for the risk posed to the bank.

It is also implementing changes to its assumptions on the relationship between the Vix and the S&P 500 indexes, building-in wilder potential swings.

More conservative stress-testing does not necessarily mean higher margins. But it will likely mean that certain positions, such as the volatility bets taken by Parplus and Ronin in March, will attract more discretionary margin from ABN Amro Clearing when exchange-level margin does come down again. Contracts on the Vix are provided by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation.

ABN Amro declines to provide details on the points concerning the restructuring of the CIB and how the clearing business might be affected. A spokesperson says: “The CIB review is [a] work in progress. We will communicate the outcome [during our] Q2 results,” on August 12.

### Scuppered?

In the meantime, there are few signs of an exodus. One executive at an FCM says that, while they have received requests for proposals, clients are not “flying away from ABN”.

“It’s a bit like NatWest – until we see a few announcements from ABN, I don’t think people will switch very quickly because they have decent pricing,” he says. “Unless they think they will get better pricing or better services somewhere else, it is still a fairly arduous task to switch provider.”

What is more likely for now, say market-watchers, is firms diversify by adding another clearing provider, rather than switching outright. A spokesperson for ABN Amro has responded to requests for comment on this point by suggesting that the bank had seen an uptick in client enquiries from other providers too.

“This is a normal reaction we often see following highly volatile markets, as clients’ strategies might have been scrutinised more than usual by their current clearing member, or clearing members could not cope with volumes or not deliver output [in a] timely [manner],” says the spokesperson.

An executive at a large proprietary trading firm tells Risk.net that his firm has been diversifying its clearing providers for years, and that the incident at ABN is a reminder that it is wise to do so.

“I mean, if you haven’t done that yet, then you’re in trouble,” he says. “Different clearing firms have different scarce resources, so it’s about optimising to their preferences. And I think you also want to have a backup. You want be able to move the positions pretty much one day to the next.”

It is not clear, however, that the smaller clients of ABN can find a home elsewhere at comparable pricing. Three large clearing firms said they were not interested in the proprietary trading firm clients of ABN Amro, and that they would not be a good fit. Two further clearing firms said they were only interested in strategic partnerships with certain clients.

“The big guys [clearing firms] are very selective, and there is no appetite for these firms,” says the head of risk at a large FCM. “Some clearers, like FCStone and Wedbush, specialise in this, but the clearing community, regardless of tier, is shrinking. RBS exited, and they had some agency prop shops on their books.”

The head of clearing at one mid-sized FCM agrees that many of the non-bank FCMs would struggle to muster the balance sheet to support prop shops, and more broadly thinks that there could be a pricing squeeze if a number of clients are forced to find new homes.

“I think you might have to see a change in some of these proprietary trading and market-making shops in the way they evaluate risk and post capital and collateral, if they want to find homes at FCMs,” adds the executive. “In their current form, I don’t know who would want to take them on.”

An executive at a large prop shop agrees with that analysis: “I think there are some smaller, not very well capitalised, PTGs that don’t have alternatives [to ABN], or the alternatives they have are not great, so for them I think a big change to the business model could have a material impact.”
