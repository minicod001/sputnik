Detecting changes in asset co-movements is of great importance to financial practitioners, with numerous risk management benefits arising from the timely detection of breakdowns in historical correlations. Bryan Lim, Stefan Zohren and Stephen Roberts propose a real-time indicator to detect temporary increases in asset co-movements that they call the autoencoder reconstruction ratio (ARR), which measures how well a basket of asset returns can be modelled using a lower-dimensional set of latent variables. Through a systemic risk application on forecasting on the Center of Research in Security Prices US Total Market Index, they show that lower ARR values coincide with higher volatility and larger drawdowns, indicating that increased asset co-movement does correspond with periods of market weakness. They also demonstrate that short-term (ie, 5-minute and 1-hour) predictors for realised volatility and market crashes can be improved by including additional ARR inputs
