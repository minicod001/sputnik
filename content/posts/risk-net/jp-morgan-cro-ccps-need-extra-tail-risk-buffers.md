{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Bail-in capital would help avoid contagion, says JPMorgan Chase's Ashley Bacon, in an interview with Risk.net_{{< /quote >}}

The chief risk officer of JPMorgan Chase has called for clearing houses to hold additional resources to cope with tail risks such as a gapping market or a catastrophic cyber event.

In an interview with Risk.net, Ashley Bacon says a stricken central counterparty should be resolved without “unexpected” demands for member firms to stump up extra cash, and argues the concept of bail-in capital could be borrowed from bank regulation.

“We are relying on the risk management practices set by central counterparties, so we need them to be of the very highest standard. We’ve published white papers in support of that view and we obviously wouldn’t have done that if we felt we were at the desired state,” he says.

In May, a JP Morgan white paper argued CCPs should have access to contingent capital, such as bonds that could be written down to mop up spillover losses – a new and largely untested concept in bank regulation.

“Exchanges are not banks and I don’t think of them as banks, but there are concepts around how banks are reasonably required to think about their own resolution that are applicable to an exchange or CCP. So to have other reliable resources, something like bail-in capital, available to cope with an extreme tail event seems a reasonable request,” says Bacon.

Bacon is the $2.5 trillion asset bank’s top risk manager, reporting to chief executive Jamie Dimon.

The bank’s white paper argued that – after margin, default funds and CCP capital had been consumed – the only tools available to resolution authorities should be the limited haircutting of variation margin and tear-up of some trades. If necessary, bail-in debt issued to unaffiliated institutional investors could then be used to recapitalise the CCP. The white paper conceded this would affect CCP operating costs but concluded that “alternative sources of recapitalization resources, particularly retained earnings by CCPs or resolution cash calls” would not be reliable enough and could result in members facing hard-to-predict liabilities.

Guidance on the resolution of CCPs was issued by the Financial Stability Board in July. It does not envisage the use of bank-style bail-in instruments.

Central clearing of over-the-counter derivatives was one of the pillars of the post-crisis reform agenda, with the first national mandates going live in 2013. Since then, the interest rate swaps market has leapt to 77% cleared, with different clearing houses now intermediating bilateral transactions and collecting margin from each party. LCH’s SwapClear is by far the largest, with an 85% share of this year’s volume by gross notional.

CCPs are now thought to be the largest source of counterparty exposure for every major derivatives dealer.

Pooling and managing the risk across a series of hubs has advantages from a systemic perspective – making the exposure more visible, and delivering greater efficiencies in terms of netting and compression. It also means the failure of a CCP could be a catastrophic event.

“The move towards greater use of CCPs, generally speaking, can be helpful if it increases netting and collateralisation – and if those things are executed well. Associated with that is greater concentration risk in those CCPs, and we should not lose sight of that. It’s a very important fact that their function is increasingly systemically important,” Bacon says.

Margin is the main resource available to a CCP – it is also the biggest drain on users of the venue, so a lot of regulatory attention has focused on ensuring clearing houses do not compete to offer ‘cheaper’ clearing services. Bacon says the bigger concern is how a CCP would cope in with abnormal conditions, such as a big gap in market prices – potentially creating a margin shortfall – or a cyber event.

“Risk management scaled for local volatility is interesting and has a level of importance, but what really matters is the extreme tail event, the big gap – or perhaps a big cyber threat to an exchange or CCP. Those are the things that need to be considered.”

The bottom line is that dipping into the pockets of members during a crisis would share the stress, rather than containing it: “They should have resolution plans that are very well thought out and not reliant on incremental, and unexpected assessments of members or taxpayers,” he says.

The full interview with Ashley Bacon will be available online tomorrow.
