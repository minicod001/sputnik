> _Optimism over EU Council amendment, but Parliament will still have to approve_

The Council of the European Union has raised hopes of securitisation special-purpose vehicles being exempt from posting margin on over-the-counter derivatives when new legislation is finalised next year.

On May 4, the European Commission published a review of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation ([Emir](https://www.risk.net/topics/european-market-infrastructure-regulation-emir)), which would [reclassify SSPVs](https://www.risk.net/regulation/emir/5264331/emir-review-could-push-securitisations-into-the-dark) as financial counterparties instead of non-financial counterparties (NFCs) and therefore subject them to collateral requirements on OTC derivatives transactions used for hedging purposes. However, a compromise text proposed by the Estonian presidency of the Council on November 15 would strike out this reclassification.

“It should be good news if the Council maintains the removal of SSPVs from the definition of a financial counterparty because it means they will still be treated how they are today and not have to post margin,” says Erik Parker, a European asset-backed securities strategist at Nomura.

If SSPVs had to exchange margin, the issuer would have to either find a lender to act as a liquidity facility and provide collateral when needed or the issuer could inject extra cash into the vehicle from the outset to cover any future margin requirements. The first option would be expensive, while the second would require the issuer to estimate how much cash they would need to reserve for future margin calls.

“One way to provide margin would be for the issuer to raise additional cash at the outset to cover this daily margining requirement, but they don’t know how much, and it is very inefficient to raise on day one if they don’t even need it,” says Parker.

The Council’s stance has already received tacit endorsement from the European Central Bank. The day after the Council compromise was proposed, ECB executive board member Yves Mersch hit out at the idea of subjecting SSPVs to margin requirements.

“Securitisation derivatives already contain features to mitigate counterparty credit risk. Moreover, the nature of the securitisationderivatives makes it difficult to comply with the margining or clearing obligation. How can an SPV put down margining as it only has, by definition, control over its underlying portfolio? How can it post collateral? …Further clarity on this is needed as many European securitisation transactions use derivatives for genuine hedging purposes,” said Mersch, speaking at a conference in Frankfurt.

In an EC work programme published in October, completing the Emir review was listed as a priority pending initiative for completion in 2018. A spokesperson for the Council says there was a meeting on November 21 and work will continue on the Emir review. A further compromise text will be published on December 1.

“The aim is to agree on the Council’s position at the ambassadors’ level before the end of the year, so negotiations with the European Parliament can start next year,” says the spokesperson.

Richard Hopkin, head of fixed income in the securitisation division at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (Afme), based in London, is optimistic the Council will agree to remove SSPVs from the financial counterparty definition.

“If that text is approved, with the deletion of SSPVs being included as financial counterparties, I think that would be a very positive step indeed because we have been arguing consistently since the proposal was first made that it is inappropriate to include them as financial counterparties. I am cautiously optimistic this will be approved – I would be very surprised if it wasn’t. The proposal will then go to the Parliament, but we will have to cross that bridge when we come to it,” says Hopkin.

### Securitisation hostility 

The Parliament has shown some hostility to securitisation in the past and it could be more difficult to get members to agree to the amendment. In 2015, the Parliament was presented with a regulation introducing a new high-quality label for securitisations, known as [simple, transparent and standardised](https://www.risk.net/regulation/2459685/compliance-burden-jeopardises-eu-securitisation-revival)(STS), which aims to revitalise the EU’s dwindling securitisation market. However, the rapporteur for the dossier, Paul Tang, a member of Parliament for the centre-left Socialists and Democrats party, attempted to [increase the risk-retention](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5275866/council-of-eu-holds-firm-to-salvage-sts-securitisations) level for all securitisations from 5% to 20%, which would potentially stifle the market instead of stimulating it.

The rapporteur for the Emir review is Werner Langen of the centre-right European People’s Party. He was also the rapporteur on the original 2011 Emir text, which classified SSPVs as NFCs. Only large NFCs, known as NFC-plus, face margin requirements under Emir. As their derivatives use is very limited, generally consisting of hedging interest rate risks in the transaction, SSPVs currently qualify as NFC-minus entities, which do not need to post margin.
