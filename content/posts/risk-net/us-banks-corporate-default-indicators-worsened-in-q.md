Systemic US banks raised probability of default (PD) estimates for corporate loans in the second quarter, as their credit models responded to the gloomy outlook for the coronavirus-ravaged economy.

The median-weighted average PD for corporate exposures across the eight US global systemically important banks (G-Sibs) was 1.7% as of end-June, up from 1.39% three months prior and at its highest level since Q3 2014. It was also the largest one-quarter change in the median since Q1 2016.

Citi and Goldman Sachs saw their average corporate PDs edge up the most of the set, by 95 basis points and 84bp to 2.85% and 3.42%, respectively.

Wells Fargo’s edged up 44bp to 1.66%, Morgan Stanley’s 41bp to 1.97%, Bank of America’s 33bp to 1.31% and JP Morgan’s 27bp to 1.82%. Custodian banks BNY Mellon and State Street saw their PDs inch up 2bp each to 0.2% and 0.24%, respectively.

Weighted-average loss given default (LGD) amounts, after factoring in the effects of credit insurance, increased at only three of the eight G-Sibs: State Street, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo. Corporate LGD increased most at State Street, by 61bp quarter-on-quarter to 26.19%.

On the flip side, LGD fell the most at BNY Mellon, by 57bp to 30.7%.

Though PDs climbed, the aggregate risk-weighted asset (RWA) amounts for corporate exposures, as calculated using the advanced approaches, dropped by over 1% to $1.48 trillion quarter on quarter. The fall can be attributed to an overall decline in corporate exposures-at-default, of 4% quarter-on-quarter to $3.57 trillion.

### What is it?

A PD reflects the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on their repayment obligations, and an LGD the amount of the loan likely to be irrecoverable in such an event.

The above PDs and LGDs are the weighted average percentages produced by each G-Sib’s internal ratings-based approach, as reported in [FFIEC 101 reporting forms](https://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/FFIEC_forms/FFIEC101_201903_i.pdf), meaning they’re based on each bank’s own data and assessment of credit risk, rather than regulator-set formula.

### Why it matters

The US economy contracted at an annualised rate of 32.9% over Q2, its worst drop on record. The collapse in output and spending has pushed businesses big and small to the brink, explaining the sharp uptick in PD at all the major lenders.

PDs and LGDs act as inputs to banks’ internal credit models, used to size regulatory RWAs, and therefore the capital charges assigned to lending portfolios under the [advanced approaches](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7566911/us-banks-face-capital-hit-from-resurgent-advanced-approaches). A sharp hike in PDs, therefore, can outweigh some or all of the effects of a reduction in exposures on RWA totals. That’s why advanced RWAs barely dropped last quarter even though exposures fell some $165 billion.

The regulator-set standardised approach for capital requirements behaves differently to banks’ advanced approaches, meaning it may take longer for the effects of the coronavirus on the economy to translate into significantly higher credit RWA levels under this lens. As most G-Sibs are currently bound by the standardised approach through the [stress capital buffer](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7568091/goldman-faces-high-stress-capital-buffer-after-fed-tests), they may be less concerned with the current high level of advanced approaches RWAs and refrain from dumping high-risk exposures.

If their credit RWAs under the standardised approach start to soar, though, some degree of downsizing may become inevitable.
