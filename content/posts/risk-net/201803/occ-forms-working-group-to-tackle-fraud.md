{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_OpRisk North America: Rise in cyber fraud prompts US regulator to reassess guidance to examiners_{{< /quote >}}

The US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is reviewing its guidance to bank examiners on assessing the adequacy of fraud detection and prevention frameworks amid a rise in cyber threats.

Speaking at the OpRisk North America conference earlier today (March 20), Lazaro Barreiro, director of governance and operational risk policy at the OCC, said the watchdog had spent the last six months building a working group dedicated to the task.

“We’re starting a fraud working group, to assess whether there is a need for additional guidance on fraud, and if there is, what kind of guidance do we need? Should it be a handbook with which to equip the examiners? Right now, we don’t have much on fraud, and when it comes to cyber, we’re seeing an increase in fraudulent activities,” he said.

Asked whether the working group’s focus was on bolstering guidance on internal or external fraud, Barreiro indicated it would encompass both, saying: “I think it’s going to be very broad fraud assessment, mostly focused on [banks’] risk management programmes for fraud.”

Senior operational risk practitioners ranked the threat of losses from [theft and fraud](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5423356/top-10-op-risks-2018-theft-and-fraud)fourth on their list of [top concerns for 2018](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5424761/top-10-operational-risks-for-2018), with many citing the fast-growing number of losses from cyber sources such as phishing attacks or online identity theft as major worries. Losses from fraud were also among the industry’s [top realised losses](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5423356/top-10-op-risks-2018-theft-and-fraud) last year.

Speaking on the sidelines of the conference, Barreiro said the working group’s primary aim was to bolster the ability of the regulator’s own bank examiners to assess whether a firm has adequate frameworks in place for frauddetection and prevention.

He gave the example of improving guidance to OCC examiners on assessing whether banks were correctly reporting losses in their credit card businesses as genuine credit losses, or whether there were in fact cases of credit card fraud going undetected or underreported.

Although the working group is still in its embryonic stages, Barreiro indicated the OCC was actively discussing the initiative with other US prudential regulators, with a view to sharing policy insights. He also indicated the watchdog could look to invite industry stakeholders to share their views with the group in future, including banks.

Speaking on the same panel as Barreiro, Glenna Hagopian, chief conduct officer and head of enterprise risk management at Citizens Financial Group, suggested her bank was reassessing the way it assigned tolerance limits to various categories of operational risk, particularly those related to fraud.

Many banks use so-called key risk indicators (KRIs) to measure their level of exposure to a given risk at a particular point in time. A classical approach to op risk dictates that by monitoring KRIs and checking outputs against internal limits and thresholds, a bank can determine whether its op risk exposures are within its risk appetite. But Hagopian questioned whether KRIs were an appropriate tool for measuring loss events for which banks have a permanently low tolerance, such as fraud.

Fraud loss, which Hagopian characterised as a cost of doing business, might have a hard limit established. By contrast, she questioned the value of assigning hard limits to potential loss events such as data breaches or failed penetration tests, pointing out an institution would not have an appetite for even one such incident. Rather, she suggested that such events would be better candidates for measurement and monitoring over time within a KRI programme.

“90% of our op risk losses are fraud. So what are we measuring, and what are we limiting? Why are we establishing limits on anything else but fraud, basically? We build the cost of fraud into our projected cost of doing business.”

Barreiro later suggested many banks – and in turn, the OCC – [were struggling](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/operational-risk/5303831/bank-cyber-chiefs-at-odds-over-risk-models) to put a dollar value on potential losses from certain types of operational risk, due to loss data and other relevant information being siloed between divisions.

“We’re having a very difficult time quantifying operational risk. The information is so scattered that it’s very difficult for us to get the metrics we need to clearly assess it. And I think it’s the same for many institutions: the exposure lies within so many different divisions, that it’s hard to step back and say ‘OK, this is our holistic view of op risk across our enterprise,’ versus looking at it within your department or division. It’s important to have a broad perspective when you’re quantifying op risk.”
