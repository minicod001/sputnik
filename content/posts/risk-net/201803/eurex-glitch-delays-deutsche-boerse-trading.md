{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Technical problems with Eurex’s T7 system delayed trading on the day of a big listing for Deutsche Börse._{{< /quote >}}

Both [Eurex](http://www.waterstechnology.com/organisations/eurex-exchange) and the [Xetra](http://www.waterstechnology.com/organisations/xetra) cash market were affected. Trading was supposed to begin at 8am Central European Time (CET). At 8:15am, [Eurex](http://www.waterstechnology.com/organisations/eurex-exchange) reported the issues had been contained, and at 9:05am the exchange listed its technical status as “resolved.”

Futures trading began at 9:20am and the cash equities market opened at 9:30am.

[Deutsche Börse](http://www.waterstechnology.com/organisations/deutsche-borse) spokespeople issued a statement in response to a request for comment, saying: “A software issue in the connectivity layer (which is needed to access markets) had to be fixed to ensure market integrity,” and added that all systems had performed stably since the delayed market open.

It’s not the first time Eurex has experienced technical problems. The exchange suffered [delays in December](https://twitter.com/EurexGroup/status/940852692699828225) and similar technical issues with the T7 system in February 2016.

On this occasion, the glitch delayed the initial public offering of Siemens Healthineers, a separately-managed healthcare business of Siemens AG, which later went ahead as planned. Despite the incident, trading volume on Xetra was €14.8 billion—almost double the monthly average.
