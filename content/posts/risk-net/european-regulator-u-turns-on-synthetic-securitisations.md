> _Deals with use-it-or-lose-it mechanism can qualify for capital relief, EBA policy expert says_

The European Banking Authority looks set to ditch a proposal that would have prevented banks using a popular form of credit enhancement in synthetic securitisations from qualifying for capital relief on the underlying assets.

The issue concerns excess spread – the surplus difference between the yield on the securitised assets and the interest paid to investors. This is used to cover the expected first losses in synthetic securitisations. Banks with high-risk loan portfolios often insert it into deals to reduce the coupon investors require for taking on the risk from the portfolio.

A discussion paper published by the EBA in September 2017 proposed banning a method of collecting excess spread that is favoured by banks – a so-called use-it-or-lose-it mechanism – from qualifying as significant risk transfer (SRT). If the mechanism was disqualified from this status, then deals including it would not reduce the originating bank’s credit risk-weighted assets under European regulation.

However, an EBA representative tells Risk.net that the regulator does not now consider that the use-it-or-lose-it mechanism should prevent a trade from qualifying under the SRT rules.

“The report on significant risk transfer is not finalised, but we don’t see the use-it-or-lose-it mechanism as preventing SRT,” says Pablo Sinausia Rodriguez, a policy expert at the EBA.

The EBA is required to finalise its review of SRT practices before January 2, 2021. The watchdog is aiming to publish the final report in the fourth quarter of this year, confirms Slavka Eley, head of banking markets, innovation and consumers at the EBA.

The ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ method involves banks accumulating a set amount of excess spread over a payment period, typically three years. If the excess spread is not fully used to cover losses, the remaining spread is returned to the bank at the end of the period. The process is then repeated until the end of the transaction’s life.

Excess spread is calculated in the securitisation contract as a percentage of the total outstanding portfolio balance.

### Caught in a trap
In its 2017 draft proposals, the EBA recommended that supervisors only allow a “trapped” form of excess spread to be present in [synthetic securitisations](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7562546/capital-relief-trades-make-slow-comeback-from-covid-slump) in order for those deals to qualify for SRT status.

The trapped mechanism accumulates excess spread throughout the life of the transaction and is always available to cover losses, even if the spread accumulated in previous years had not been used.

Banks argued this reduced the actual amount of risk transferred, as the more excess spread accumulated over time the smaller the chances losses would exceed the stacked up excess spread.

“In the discussion paper published in 2017 the EBA concluded that the use-it-or-lose-it mechanism is more compatible with a transfer of risk because it provides less credit enhancement for investors – so from a transfer of risk perspective the regulators should prefer it – but nevertheless the trapped [method] was the only one that they would accept. It seemed contradictory,” says a senior structurer at a European bank.

The EBA’s discussion paper allowed banks to deduct from their capital the yearly funded and unfunded amount of excess spread, which is effectively a first loss tranche on the securitisation transaction that is retained by the bank.

The use-it-or-lose-it mechanism would result in lower capital deductions, because it often doesn’t build up as much excess spread as the trapped mechanism.

Since the size of excess spread increases and shrinks throughout the transaction’s life, supervisors cannot be sure at the start of the transaction how much risk actually is transferred, and therefore how much should count towards a bank’s credit risk-weighted assets.

For example, if excess spread is accumulated every three years at €100 a year, then a €500 loss in the first year would mean the investor suffers a €400 loss. Assuming there are no losses in the rest of the period, banks can pocket the €200 excess spread at the end of the payment period.

If the instrument suffers a €500 loss in year three, the investor only loses €200 and the bank gets no excess spread.

### Capital charge
The EBA stated in the 2017 discussion paper that it was considering whether a separate Pillar 1 charge should be applied to SRT transactions that have excess spread mechanisms, because the mechanism could result in a lower amount of risk being transferred than the competent authority realises.

Sources say the reason regulators originally opted for the trapped mechanism was because it would be easier to then apply risk-weighted assets and capital charges to the total amount of excess spread at the transaction’s inception.

“Requiring the excess spread trapping mechanism rather than use-it-or-lose-it makes little sense from a risk transfer perspective but it made sense to regulators as they were looking for a way to apply some capital requirement against it,” says Giuliano Giovannetti, a managing director at advisory firm Granular Investments.

The EBA declined to confirm whether it intends to allow the trapped mechanism as a form of excess spread in the upcoming SRT report. The senior structurer at the European bank believes the regulator will allow it.

The EBA also wouldn’t confirm whether it will ultimately propose a Pillar 1 capital requirement for synthetic excess spread.

“A possible capital requirement for excess spread was something that was placed for discussion in the paper from 2017 but we have not made a final decision yet,” says Rodriguez of the EBA.

### Seal of approval

The EBA published a final report in May on the creation of a high-quality label for balance sheet synthetic securitisations, designed to restore investor confidence in the instruments and boost issuance. In the report, the regulator allows deals with the use-it-or-lose-it mechanism to qualify for the simple, transparent and standardised ([STS](https://www.risk.net/regulation/6791966/synthetic-securitisations-and-europes-capital-sweetener)) label.

To qualify for STS, the bank must not put in excess spread equivalent to more than one year of their expected credit loss for the portfolio each year.

Four sources tell Risk.net that as the method qualifies for STS, it makes sense for the EBA to relax its ban on use-it-or-lose-it under the SRT rules.

“The inclusion of the use-it-or-lose-it mechanism for STS is recognition of our understanding that it is reflecting what is going to be in the final SRT paper, which is good,” says the senior structurer at the European bank.

The move reverses a previous [proposal](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7103956/structural-snags-frustrate-sts-for-synthetics) by the EBA in September 2019 not to allow synthetic securitisations with any form of excess spread to qualify for the STS label.

“I can see why the EBA were concerned from an SRT point of view because excess spread has sometimes been used to play fast and loose with the rules, but to prevent excess spread being used at all is throwing the baby out with the bathwater,” says Ian Bell, chief executive of Prime Collateralised Securities, a non-profit organisation that verifies STS-compliant deals. “There are perfectly sensible ways to make sure it is not abused other than getting rid of it.”

With the acceptance of the use-it-or-lose-it mechanism for STS, a consultant says it would be illogical for the EBA to maintain the proposed ban in the SRT discussion paper.

“I don’t see how they can’t accept use-it-or-lose-it for SRT,” says the consultant. “Otherwise they are proposing to give a label for high quality to a structure they then effectively ban.”

Even more intriguingly, the EBA does not allow the trapped mechanism to be present in deals qualifying for STS.

“The use-it-or-lose-it mechanism…is simpler in our view,” explains Rodriguez of the EBA. “As we are targeting this criteria of simplicity then obviously we are including the simplest synthetic excess spread.”

Giovannetti of Granular Investments expects national supervisors in the European Union will now take into account the EBA’s recent report on creating an STS label for synthetic securitisations when determining whether deals achieve SRT.

Some supervisors had been using the rules drafted in the EBA’s discussion paper on SRT as final and so limited the presence of the use-it-or-lose-it mechanism in deals.

“In the absence of any other guidance the EBA discussion paper has sometimes been used by supervisors as cast in stone,” says Giovannetti. “So because this new paper on STS goes against what was in the SRT discussion paper by allowing the use-it-or-lose-it mechanism, it will presumably now inform supervisors that excess spread is not bad in itself, and that they need to look at the specifics of each transaction.”
