Adverse adjustments to the valuation of non-cleared derivatives (XVAs) at HSBC [continued](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7534991/xvas-take-346m-bite-out-of-hsbc) to sap earnings over the three months to end-June. Over the first six months of the year, credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) have lopped a combined $355 million off of income.

The hit was recorded at the UK firm’s global banking and markets (GB&M) division, and was equivalent in size to 4% of first-half revenues. Over the half-year to June 2019, CVA and FVA contributed $14 million to income.

Though these adjustments dented the firm’s profits, shareholders’ equity benefited from an increase in [debit valuation adjustment (DVA)](https://www.risk.net/definition/debit-valuation-adjustment-dva), which lowers the value of certain derivatives liabilities as the obligor’s creditworthiness deteriorates. This added $2.4 billion to equity over the first half, whereas it took away $1.4 billion the same period a year ago.

GB&M revenues for the first half came in at $8.2 billion, up from $7.6 billion the year-ago period. Of this, $4.4 billion was accrued in Q2, and $3.7 billion in Q1.

HSBC’s derivatives assets totalled $313.8 billion, down from 15% on end-March but 29% more than at end-2019. Derivatives liabilities moved in tandem, also falling 15% quarter-on-quarter to $303.1 billion, but up 27% on Q4 2019.

### What is it?

[Credit valuation adjustment (CVA)](https://www.risk.net/definition/credit-valuation-adjustment-cva) is a change to the market value of a derivatives instrument to account for counterparty credit risk. It represents the discount to the standard derivatives value that a buyer would offer after taking into account the possibility of a counterparty’s default

[Funding valuation adjustment (FVA)](https://www.risk.net/definition/funding-valuation-adjustment-fva) is the cost that arises when a dealer is unable to directly pass variation margin from an out-of-the-money client to an in-the-money client. The dealer then has to fund the margin itself, generating a cost.

[Debit valuation adjustment (DVA)](https://www.risk.net/definition/debit-valuation-adjustment-dva) reflects the credit risk of the bank writing the contract; it is often thought of as the negative of CVA – that is, a bank’s DVA is its counterparty’s CVA. It applies primarily to uncollateralised derivatives liabilities and reflects the benefit to a bank from a deterioration in its credit quality.

### Why it matters

Major markets settled somewhat in the latter half of the second quarter, but fears about the economic effects of the coronavirus kept credit spreads elevated relative to their pre-pandemic levels. As CVA and FVA are generally calculated in reference to credit spreads, this explains the huge rise in charges relative to a year ago.

HSBC may have seen its overall XVA hit worsen [only slightly](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7534991/xvas-take-346m-bite-out-of-hsbc) on Q1, but some of its rivals actually managed to reverse much of the hit they incurred over the first three months. [JP Morgan](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7654996/jp-morgan-posts-510m-xva-gain), for instance, posted a $510 million XVA gain over Q2, which partially offset the $951 million adverse hit it suffered in Q1.

It may be that HSBC’s counterparties have not seen their credit spreads tighten as far or as fast as those of its US-based rival. Though this is just one of the prices banks must pay in the course of doing business, if XVAs continue to sap earnings meaningfully, HSBC may consider migrating some portfolios into clearing, or shuttering relationships with some shaky credits entirely.
