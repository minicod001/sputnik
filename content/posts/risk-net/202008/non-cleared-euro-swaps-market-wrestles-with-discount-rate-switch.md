Buy-side firms face valuation problems and possible delays in amending collateral contracts for non-cleared euro interest rate swaps ahead of Eonia’s end date, experts warn.

Swaps holders are looking to switch the rate for collateral payments from Eonia to the euro short-term rate, or €STR, in thousands of legacy contracts. This would bring the swaps in line with the discount rate used for cleared trades after a recent change at major clearing houses.

The work requires manually updating bilateral agreements known as credit support annexes (CSAs). Counterparties must decide whether to adopt a new rate of €STR flat to match the clearing houses, or €STR plus 8.5 basis points to mirror Eonia, which tracks €STR with a fixed spread.

Using €STR flat would result in a valuation change, which could be hard to calculate, dealers warn.

A person involved in CSA transitions at a large European bank says the valuation process is “not a straightforward exercise and is operationally intensive”.

“Often a broad universe of trades across asset classes and across internal systems needs to be captured for each individual CSA,” the source adds.

A trader at a European asset manager agrees that trawling through individual trades with every counterparty will be time-consuming.

“You need to base everything on the same assumptions, the same data, and the same positions. Aligning that takes a couple of hours with each counterparty,” the trader says.

On July 27, central counterparties switched from Eonia to €STR for discounting future cashflows and calculating interest payments on collateral, known as price alignment interest (PAI), for euro swaps. Rates on US dollar swaps will see a similar move – from federal funds to SOFR – in October (see box: Dollar swaps face bigger hurdle).

Changing the rate for cleared swaps is seen as a key milestone for the broader transition of financial products towards risk-free rates. Market participants reported a smooth switch at clearing houses including LCH and Eurex: “without even the slightest hiccup,” says one buy-side derivatives trader.

Clearing houses are using a cash compensation mechanism to square up the winners and losers from the valuation change. A holder of an in-the-money swap would see their position increase in value due to the 8.5bp reduction in the discount rate.

For non-cleared swaps, counterparties have expressed a preference for €STR flat in their amended CSAs to align with the clearing houses. The rate used to make payments on collateral dictates the discount rate for these swaps.

Deepak Sitlani, a partner at law firm Linklaters, says: “There is definitely a need and a desire to update existing CSAs so that they refer to €STR flat. Market participants will live with a period of time where the clearing houses are discounting €STR flat and the non-cleared trades are effectively on Eonia. But over the next year or so, they will look to update their CSAs bilaterally.”

Any mismatch between cleared swaps valued at €STR flat and bilateral swaps with the 8.5bp spread could cause problems for firms hedging one type of swap against the other. Firms may also struggle to price non-cleared swaps using the cleared curves as a reference point.

“Your risk profile is slightly different. But if you have a system that can differentiate between those swaps, then that’s fine,” says Marcel Mulleners, a senior fixed income investment manager at Netherlands-based PGGM.

A similar valuation change for swaptions is causing [debate](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7547201/swaptions-compensation-method-divides-market) among counterparties over how to compensate the losers from the switch in discount rate.

Netherlands and UK investment manager Cardano plans to shift all its CSAs by year-end to reference €STR without an added spread, says Max Verheijen, director of financial markets at the firm. “We advocate staying as close as possible to the market, and we think that is in the interest of our clients,” he said at a recent Risk.net webinar.

### Time’s ticking

The work to amend CSAs for non-cleared swaps is taking on increased urgency as the market moves towards the termination of Eonia in January 2022. Swaps holders could face legal confusion at the point of Eonia’s disappearance if they fail to address CSAs that lack fallback provisions to switch to an alternative rate.

However, some buy-side firms may experience delays in changing the documentation as banks prioritise interdealer trades, observers warn.

Shankar Mukherjee, Ibor transition lead at consultancy EY, says banks will first address their CSAs with other dealers before reaching out to their buy-side clients, likely leading to a drawn-out process.

Linklaters’ Sitlani agrees that the interdealer market will amend its CSAs first and says the dealer-to-client agreements will likely be addressed this year and over the course of 2021.

Nicolas Caseris, global head of FVA and differential discounting trading at Nomura, says the bank has only been approached by a few larger, more sophisticated clients, but anticipates discussions will pick up from September.

“The counterparties that have made enquiries to move the CSAs quickly are some of the direct clearing members, high-velocity counterparties, or counterparties that are active in the options space,” he says.

Firms can switch the discounting rate in the CSA by referencing Isda’s collateral agreement interest rate definitions, which were published earlier this year and cover €STR. Amended definitions for SOFR will be published in the near future, and Risk.net understands market participants have seen a draft of the definitions.

Some asset managers have already begun the process of updating CSAs. PGGM has amended some of its agreements and plans to have the remaining agreements with more than 10 counterparties completed in the coming months, Mulleners says.

Other firms are content to accept a temporary discounting mismatch between cleared and uncleared trades, and are not scrambling to amend their CSAs yet.

“[Convergence] will happen over time as market consensus develops and market participants work through operational changes and discussions around compensation payments to account for any value transfer. I don’t think there’s a big move to start changing everyone’s CSAs at this point in time,” says Tom Roberts, partner at law firm Allen & Overy.

Mulleners notes that there’s an additional challenge for discussions involving CSAs that allow for bonds to serve as collateral. Depending on the swap’s maturity, high-quality government debt trades between €STR and Eonia in the repo market.

When discounted at Eonia, pledging cash as collateral is cheapest for banks, so having the ability to post bonds as collateral does not influence valuations. But discounting at €STR can make the bonds cheaper to deliver than cash.

While some believe trades with bond collateral should be [discounted at a repo rate](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5299256/the-price-is-still-wrong-banks-tackle-bond-csa-discounting), Mulleners says firms may have to settle for a CSA that allows bonds to be discounted at €STR with an additional spread.

Mulleners says PGGM has been surprised that some banks have attempted to charge clients for the interest rate risk inherent in a switch from Eonia to €STR. Some dealers may need to change their hedges as a result of the rate switch, and are seeking to pass these costs on to clients.

“We’re seeing some banks that try to either charge clients for this impact or enforce to exchange the extra interest rate risk involved. We don’t agree with this behaviour. If banks need to hedge the extra risk that arises because of this, they cannot charge clients,” he says.

#### Dollar swaps face bigger hurdle

For holders of US dollar swaps, the valuation challenge could be even more acute, experts believe. In October, clearing houses will switch PAI and discount rates from the federal funds rate to SOFR, the chosen risk-free rate for the dollar market.

The basis between these two rates is not fixed, as in the euro market, but floating. As a result, non-cleared swaps counterparties seeking to mimic this change may have to agree multiple hedges on different curves and tenor points.

“It’s going to be quite complicated,” says Nicolas Caseris at Nomura.

A trader at a large US-based asset manager agrees that setting a spread adjustment for US dollar trades will be a tall order.

“I doubt anyone would want to agree to lock in a single, discrete SOFR/fed funds spread on the entirety of any single CSA at this point,” the trader says.

If banks reach an impasse over valuations, some believe counterparties might need to strike new CSAs referencing SOFR and maintain the legacy contacts for past trades.

However, there may be less incentive to shift CSAs for US dollar swaps since the fed funds rate shows little sign of disappearing.

“I believe there has been very little migration towards SOFR cash compensation in legacy bilateral CSAs. It just isn’t a priority – fed funds isn’t going away,” says the trader at the asset manager.
