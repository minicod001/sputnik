French bank Natixis saw its market risk-weighted assets (RWAs) hit €18.2 billion ($21.4 billion) over Q2, up from just €12.2 billion at end-March, the result of surging risk-of-loss estimates for its trading book and a portfolio of trades supposed to offset the earnings-sapping effects of derivatives valuation adjustments.

Total RWAs amounted to €103.3 billion at end-June, up 3% quarter-on-quarter. In contrast to market RWAs, credit RWAs decreased 2% to €63 billion and counterparty credit RWAs 11% to €6.6 billion over the quarter.

Market risk model inputs that feed into RWA calculations deteriorated over Q2, explaining some of the market RWA increase. For example, average daily value-at-risk for Natixis’s trading portfolio hit €18.1 million over Q2, compared with €8.5 million over Q1.

But Natixis also said the way in which valuation adjustment (XVA) hedges are incorporated in the market RWA calculation were responsible.

The increase in market RWAs contributed to a depletion of the bank’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio to 11.2% from 11.4% at end-March.

### What is it?

Market RWAs are calculated using either the internal model approach (IMA) or standardised approach (SA). The IMA market risk calculation consists of four components: a VAR-based requirement; a SVAR-based requirement; an incremental risk charge; and risks-not-in-VAR measure.

The VAR- and SVAR-based RWA amounts are calculated by applying a multiplier to banks’ own model outputs. Natixis’s trading VAR is calibrated to a one-day time horizon and a 99% confidence level, meaning losses should only exceed the modelled estimate one trading day out of every 100.

### Why it matters

Natixis was at pains to inform stakeholders that the huge increase in its market RWAs was a quirk of regulation, not a runaway build-up of risks.

Special blame was laid on how the IMA accounts for derivatives valuation adjustments. The firm said a bunch of active trades had been put on to hedge these XVAs, which incurred [€126 million of losses](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7540951/credit-agricole-natixis-unicredit-pummelled-by-xva-losses) in Q1 but contributed €54 million to income in Q2.

However, the IMA, while factoring in the market risk of these trades, does not include the offsetting impacts of the XVAs themselves. Put simply, the XVA hedges are “naked”, and appear as purely directional trades under the regulatory lens.

Natixis expects XVA effects, and therefore the mark-to-market volatility of its hedges, to shrink down over the second half of the year, which should lead to a commensurate drop in RWAs. But nothing is certain. If the market experiences another loss in confidence later this year, the bank may have to decide whether it’s better to have XVAs ravage its income, or XVA hedges consume vast amounts of regulatory capital.
