Societe Generale will reshuffle its structured product mix and look to sell some legacy books to competitors after reporting a €200 million ($237 million) loss related to the instruments in its second-quarter results.

The latest hit brings the bank’s year-to-date losses on structured products to €400 million. First-half equity trading revenue is down 90% as a result.

“We will consider any opportunity to de-risk the portfolios we don’t want to keep, so if there is a possibility to sell, we will consider it,” said Severin Cabannes, SG’s deputy chief executive, speaking on the bank’s August 3 earnings call. “Those structured products portfolios are not easy to sell because there are not so many counterparts in a position to buy it. But if there were some interest, we would look at that.”

Cabannes is stepping down from his post at the end of 2020 and will retire in 2021 after 20 years at the French dealer.

Societe Generale is not the only French bank beating a retreat from the structured products business. Natixis also plans to slim its structured product book and run off some positions after a €143 million markdown sent the firm’s equity trading division into the red for the second quarter running.

Natixis’s trimmed equity derivatives business will primarily service parent company BPCE’s retail networks – a move that would cut revenues in the equity division by an estimated 25%, or roughly €100 million–140 million per year, according to chief financial officer Nathalie Bricker.

“Even though no one could have foreseen this event, it has been an incentive for us to launch projects in order to review our positioning in equity derivatives,” Bricker said on the bank’s second-quarter earnings call on August 4. “This project could lead us to focus on group BPCE retail networks as well as some of our key strategic clients and adapt our offering accordingly. This project could also lead us to manage the rest of the business in run-off mode.”

Full details of the overhaul will be revealed in November when newly appointed chief executive Nicolas Namias announces his strategic plan. Namias – formerly chief financial officer at BPCE – takes over from Francois Raihi, who stepped down following a loss-making first quarter for the bank.

Societe Generale plans to de-risk its autocallable activities and focus on products that are less sensitive to market dislocations. This includes environmental, social and governance-related investments and more products linked to bespoke fixed dividend indexes, which eliminate long dividend exposures. The shake-up is expected to result in a €200 million–250 million drop in annual revenue – equivalent to around 10% of full-year 2019 earnings at the equity division. The bank also aims to slash €450 million in costs across its corporate and investment bank.

### Autocallables in the frame

The equity trading losses at the French banks stem largely from the [hedging of autocallable notes](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7537266/how-axed-dividends-left-socgen-in-a-eu200-million-hole). These accounted for 60% – or $150 billion – of the $250 billion-equivalent of structured products issued globally in 2019.

Autocallables typically track equity indexes or baskets of stocks and deliver juicy coupons while spot remains between upside and downside barriers. The structure knocks out when spot hits the upside barrier, returning principal and an improved coupon. If the downside barrier – typically set at 40% below the initial index level – is breached, a knock-in put option is triggered and investors could lose a portion of their principal.

Issuers are exposed to a range of risk parameters, such as volatility, correlation and skew, which can whipsaw wildly when markets turn sour.

“When the markets are not normal these products are impossible to hedge. And Covid is probably the most abnormal,” says David Hendler, principal of Viola Risk Advisors. “Everything that was a fat tail risk that wasn’t supposed to happen is happening every other quarter.”

Most of the losses have come from exposure to corporate dividends. Structured product issuers hedge some of this risk with dividend futures or over-the-counter swaps. But upcoming dividends paid from prior-year earnings are assumed to be guaranteed and generally not hedged. In March, those assumptions proved wrong – and costly. Scores of the Euro Stoxx 50 constituents – a popular autocall index – pulled pre-announced payouts, sending front-year Eurex-listed ES50 dividend futures into meltdown.

BNP Paribas, Natixis and SG have reported a combined €857 million of [dividend-related markdowns](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7541296/pressure-grows-on-structured-product-issuers-as-losses-mount) in their structured products businesses since the start of the year.

Dividend cuts were not the only source of losses. The sale of so-called “worst of” autocalls linked to the most volatile stock or index in a basket left dealers short correlation. “Being short correlation was nasty because the market went down quickly and everything was correlated, but then the market was also very correlated when you went back up. As a trader, you need to hedge your risks dynamically, and in times of stress the bid-ask you pay to re-hedge is wider, so everything costs you more,” says Eric Barthe, head of financial engineering at analytics firm Anova Partners.

“This is money you burn if you want to re-hedge, but given how the markets behaved, you cannot afford not to re-hedge,” he says.

At large, diversified equity businesses, structured product losses were offset by a spike in flow trading. Second-quarter equity revenues jumped 46% and 38% at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, respectively. For French dealers that traffic more in structured products, especially in longer-dated retail instruments, there was nowhere to hide.

“The US banks are less exposed to those long-term autocalls on the Euro Stoxx 50, and they tend to have a more diversified type of flow,” says Barthe. “US banks also have more hedge fund flow that tends to offset risks coming from retail flow, and it is this flow which makes a difference.”

Some say the retreat is overdue. Natixis’s equity derivatives business has suffered a series of missteps in recent years. The French dealer took a €260 million hit in 2018 after a hedging strategy for autocallable bonds sold to South Korean investors proved [woefully inadequate](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6229806/natixiss-eu260m-hit-linked-to-rapid-asia-expansion-and-kospi3-leverage). A year later, a senior US equity derivatives trader was suspended over trade reporting. The latest dividend debacle has cost the dealer €273 million this year – equivalent to 80% of revenue reported by the equity business in the first half of 2019.

“Natixis’s structured product activity was really outsized. They just don’t have the quantitative investment strategies business or vanilla flow activity to balance that out and we don’t really see them on the risk-recycling side. The easy part of structured products is to be present, but you need diversification to be resilient,” says one equity structurer at a US house.

Others wonder how SG and Natixis will plug their revenue gaps. “It’s so tempting to make money this way if you don’t have the other businesses and it doesn’t seem like anything else is kicking in headline growth,” says Hendler. “Fixed income did well, but that was highly unusual and not really repeatable. Insurance and asset management did OK, but there may be hidden risks that will play out poorly.”

BNP Paribas was an outlier among French banks, seeing a recovery at its equity division in the second quarter. The bank’s equity division reported €290 million of revenue – with only a “residual impact” from dividend restrictions – after losing €184 million in the first three months of the year.
