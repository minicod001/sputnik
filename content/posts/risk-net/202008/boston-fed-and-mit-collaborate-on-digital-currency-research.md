The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is collaborating with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on building and testing a “hypothetical central bank digital currency”.

The two- to three-year project will begin by developing a CBDC for “wide-scale, general purpose use”, the Boston Fed says.

“The objective in this phase will be to determine how to architect a scalable, accessible cryptographic platform to meet the needs of a theoretical US dollar CBDC, including stringent design requirements for speed, security, privacy and resiliency,” it adds.

Later phases will explore the technology in greater detail by coding various different software architectures for the system. Research results will be published jointly by the Boston Fed and MIT, and any code will be released as open-source software.

In parallel with the work at MIT, the Boston Fed will evaluate other systems that could be used to support a CBDC.

“We are thrilled to be working with the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT and our colleagues in the Federal Reserve system to learn the intricacies of building a CBDC platform,” says Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren.

Jim Cunha, the Boston Fed’s senior vice-president for secure payments and fintech, will lead its team in the project. A former member of the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, James Lovejoy, has taken a position as lead engineer for digital currency research at the Boston Fed. MIT is now seeking a new software engineer to work on the collaboration.

Fed governor Lael Brainard says the collaboration fitted with a broader programme of work undertaken across the Federal Reserve system to better understand CBDCs. “Given the dollar’s important role, it is essential that the Federal Reserve remain on the frontier of research and policy development regarding CBDCs,” she says.

A team from the Fed board and Cleveland, Dallas and New York Feds has been testing distributed ledger platforms “to understand their potential opportunity and risk”, Brainard says. The Fed has also been participating in a “coalition” of central banks that are working to understand CBDCs.

However, Brainard stresses the Fed is some way off from committing to issue a CBDC. Even to consider issuing a digital currency would require a “significant policy process”, she says, involving “extensive deliberations” with the federal government and a “broad set of other stakeholders”. There also might be a need for amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, she adds.

“The Federal Reserve has not made a decision whether to undertake such a significant policy process, as we are taking the time and effort to understand the significant implications of digital currencies and CBDCs around the globe,” Brainard says.
