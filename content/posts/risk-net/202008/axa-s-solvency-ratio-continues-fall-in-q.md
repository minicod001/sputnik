French insurer Axa’s core capital ratio dropped a further two percentage points in Q2 to 180%, its lowest since the European Union-wide insurance regulatory framework came into force in 2016.

Over the first three months of the year, its Solvency II ratio fell 16pp, the most since Q3 2018. The decline was driven by a depletion of capital due to debt repayment and dividend accrual. Earnings added a single percentage point to the ratio over Q2, compared to five over Q1.

Its solvency position could erode further if interest rates continue to fall. Axa said a 50 basis point decrease would lop a further 14pp off its Solvency II ratio.

However, it also expects an assortment of management actions to have a beneficial effect over the second half of the year. The integration of property and casualty insurer XL, [acquired in 2018](https://www.axa.com/en/press/press-releases/axa-has-completed-the-acquisition-of-xl-group), to its internal model should boost the group’s ratio by five to ten percentage points, while other asset sales should net it 6pp of relief.

### What is it?

Under Solvency II, an insurer’s solvency ratio is the ratio of eligible own funds to its solvency capital requirement. The latter is calculated as the amount of own-funds needed for the insurer to honour policyholder obligations after a one-in-200-year stress event.

### Why it matters

Axa predicts its Solvency II ratio will rebound on the back of management actions over the second half of the year, but these represent one-time fillips and cannot prop up its capital position over the long term.

For that, Axa needs to find a way to boost its earnings, either through increased investment income or a better underwriting result. It could also counter the erosion of its ratio through market risk by rejigging its hedging strategy.
