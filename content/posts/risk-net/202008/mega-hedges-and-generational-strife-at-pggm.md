{{< quote steelblue >}}_Buy-side risk survey: for Dutch pension giant, battle between young and old shaped response to March mayhem_{{< /quote >}}

This is the tenth in a series of articles connected to our buy-side risk survey. Click [here](https://www.risk.net/topics/buy-side-risk-survey-2020) to read the rest of the series.

Arjen Pasma is 46 years old. In the Netherlands, where Pasma lives, it’s an age with a special significance – the tipping point when an individual’s slowly growing pension entitlement starts to outweigh the flat premium paid throughout that worker’s career.

It means Pasma – the chief risk officer of €250 billion ($296.3 billion) pension giant PGGM – has a personal stake in the long-running debate about how to reform the Dutch pension system and its huge, collectively owned pots of assets.

“Because younger people can take on more risk than older people, when you’re young you’re basically paying too much premium for the pension drawing rights you’ve built up,” says Pasma.

“The tipping point is around 45 or 46, so I’ve effectively paid too much premium for my whole career – but if you reset the system right now, where is all of that wealth going? It may look like it’s going from one generation to another. That wealth transfer needs to be corrected: everyone needs to get the pension they paid for.”

For more than a decade, that goal has consumed – and divided – the Netherlands, where as much as 90% of all pension assets are invested in the public system. Pasma and others are hopeful a proposal to create individual pension accounts has enough support to make it into law.

The problem with the current defined benefit system is that the benefits are not defined enough. As the official discount rate – the “rekenrente” – has slumped towards zero over the past decade, Dutch pension funds have seen the present value of their liabilities balloon and their coverage ratios slip – at the fund belonging to PGGM’s largest client, the ratio has dropped to 85.9% from 96.5% in 2019. This crimps payouts to today’s pensioners.

A tempting solution is to hike the discount rate – a position energetically championed by 50Plus, a political party launched in 2009 specifically to advocate for current pensioners. That would result in higher payouts for them, but would also drain the pot available to younger workers.

The result is what Pasma calls “intergenerational conflict” – a struggle between young and old that threatens the ‘we’re-all-in-this-together’ ethos of the public pension system.

“If you assume a rate of 4%, then the coverage ratios of most pension funds would increase substantially – the average duration of the liabilities is around 20 years. You could index returns to inflation and even start topping up past payments,” says Pasma. “But then you start to pay out a huge amount of wealth to a baby boom generation that is already quite wealthy, and the payouts would come from what is currently the buffer for the young generation. That is where you literally start to see intergenerational solidarity tested.”

The solution currently making its way through the Dutch legislative process would, for the first time, create individual accounts for pensioners. It would complement these with a buffer account, which would be plumped up primarily by siphoning off some returns: “It’s basically to compensate those generations that are relatively unlucky; the generations that are relatively lucky will pass on some of their returns,” says Pasma.

These reforms – slated to take effect in 2026, with a 10-year transition period to follow – are a huge deal for the Dutch pension industry, and for millions of existing investors. As PGGM’s 2019 annual report puts it: “In the coming 10 years, more is likely to change in the Dutch pension landscape than in the past 40 years.”

### Tanker in a storm

This shifting backdrop is crucial to understanding PGGM’s attitude to risk. For example, intense scrutiny from regulators, and a well-informed public, influenced some of the firm’s behaviour in March, when the spreading coronavirus [triggered mayhem](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7505206/us-treasury-market-holds-its-breath-after-high-drama) across the financial markets.

On the one hand, PGGM is generally able to look past these gyrations.

“We don’t try to do all kinds of short-term trades, it’s not our policy. We just have to make sure we navigate this tanker through the storm without suffering too much damage,” says Pasma.

On the other, it wasn’t at all clear when or how [March’s storm](https://www.risk.net/investing/7658331/before-and-after-the-covid-19-storm-buy-side-risk-survey) would end, which prompted some discussion about the tanker’s course. PGGM generally reviews and rebalances its books on at least a monthly basis, often topping up asset classes that have sold off and now look cheap, Pasma says. During the Covid-19 volatility, this strategy was questioned by the firm’s board.

“It’s a classic behavioural finance issue – your risk appetite is reference-point-dependent, right? So, when you have a coverage ratio of 99%, which was the case at the end of December, it was fine to buy equities in a falling market. But when interest rates also decline a lot, leaving us two months later at a coverage ratio of 84%, there were some board members who had concerns about adding more risk – it was the right conversation to have,” he says.

Ultimately, the firm left its rebalancing process untouched. The decision paid off, as stock markets rapidly clawed back their March drawdown – helping offset losses in what Pasma describes as “quite a big” commodities book.

Around 30% of the firm’s assets are tied up in private markets. These are large infrastructure, insurance-linked, and risk-sharing transactions with an average deal size of around €200 million – as well as private equity deals that range up to roughly €100 million. By their nature, these are not positions that can be quickly traded if markets turn south, but Pasma says the early indications of asset price declines are not as bad as feared. In commercial property, PGGM had less exposure to shopping malls and offices – which have been hit harder by the lockdown – than to logistics-focused facilities, which have proved more resilient.

In all, he says: “It hasn’t been a terrific year returns-wise, but we’ve done reasonably well so far.”

### “Assume nothing”

March posed other threats to the PGGM tanker. In the Netherlands, lockdown was more selective than in many other European countries – schools were quickly shut down, but many businesses remained open, essentially betting that distancing and hygiene measures would be enough to control the spread of the virus.

One of the first actions PGGM took was to obtain dispensation from the government so that if the lockdown was extended, the firm would still be allowed to keep a skeleton crew at its Zeist headquarters, not far from Utrecht.

“We wanted those people to have a stable connection and a Bloomberg machine, rather than working from a laptop at home,” says Pasma.

So far, that dispensation has not been needed. Although the Netherlands, like many other European countries, has recently tightened up its restrictions, it never applied a nationwide stay-at-home rule. As a result, roughly 80 of the 450 staff in PGGM’s investments division – which includes Pasma’s team of 45 – were in the office at any time during the first months of the crisis, rotating between home and remote working.

{{< img src="/img/MegaHedge_01.png" float="float" orientation="right" marginLeft="15px" marginTop="15px" marginBottom="15px" marginRight="15px" width="350px">}}

Having the bulk of staff working from home did require the [now-familiar](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/operational-risk/7665801/moonshots-shelved-banks-spend-on-home-working-tech) change of working practices and patterns, of course – ensuring remote staff had the hardware, software and connectivity to [do their jobs](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7545411/inside-march-madness-with-citis-tuchman) without interruption, and convening regular meetings to help co-ordinate responses to the global panic. PGGM’s freshly formed financial crisis team started meeting in early March, just before the first [headline-grabbing falls](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7501356/dispersion-trades-suffer-in-coronavirus-selloff) in oil and stock markets.

There was also a change of emphasis, with Pasma pressing his team not to take anything for granted.

“We made sure people were following protocol, following processes. You cannot assume anything about what your colleague might or might not have checked. You can’t see it, you can’t look over your shoulder and call ‘Have you checked this?’ and get a ‘Yes, I have’ nod in reply. So, assume nothing. And that worked really well. We had no operational incidents,” he says.

The focus on operations and [operational risk](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7491576/a-peek-inside-op-risk-managers-coronavirus-toolkit) extended to third parties, of course – where there was at least one slip-up involving a third-party manager of some PGGM assets.

“It was a typical operational incident in which a rebalancing in the portfolio was not executed the way it was supposed to, due to communication issues. Because of the highly volatile markets, correcting such a mistake can be costly. We realise these errors occur, but it was a wake-up call for us that such an error could also have happened on our side,” says Pasma.

{{< img src="/img/MegaHedge_02.png" float="float" orientation="right" marginLeft="15px" marginTop="15px" marginBottom="15px" marginRight="15px" width="350px">}}

Alongside operational exposures, PGGM also kept a closer eye on liquidity risk during March.

Because PGGM hedges the impact falling rates have on its coverage ratio, the firm started receiving huge amounts of collateral – up to €1 billion in a day, Pasma estimates – while simultaneously paying out to counterparties on its nosediving commodity positions. The firm’s trading and treasury teams were “extremely busy” checking the [margin totals](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7517436/sluggish-back-office-systems-added-to-margin-pressures) and chasing the incoming assets, making sure the payments it was owed actually arrived.

In another liquidity flap – after comparing notes with other pension managers – the firm withdrew all of its assets from one of the third-party funds in which it parks liquidity.

“If these funds put all of their assets in overnight cash, then you’re losing money at the moment. So what they do is hold some in tradeable securities. We were paying very close attention to the liquidity profile of these funds – and we did end up replacing one particular fund with another because we were not convinced that it was sufficiently liquid. And because we were seeing these huge swings, particularly in our quality book and our rates book, our risk tolerance for liquidity was basically zero,” says Pasma.

### The mother of all hedges

Away from the pandemic, life goes on. PGGM’s huge interest rate derivatives book is an oil tanker in its own right, and currently requires some deft handling. Pasma won’t say precisely how big the book is, but the DV01 – its sensitivity to a one-basis point move in rates – is “north of €100 million”.

He also puts it more simply: “It’s humongous.”

It faces three big changes – first, global [reform](https://www.risk.net/topics/libor) of the Libor family of interest rate benchmarks, and other benchmarks based on interbank offered rates, which are referenced in the vast majority of outstanding swaps and swaptions. Second, the ongoing push to centrally clear more of these over-the-counter trades. And finally, the new Dutch pension system and its consequences for the official discount rate.

The probable death of Libor, which could happen as early as the end of 2021 – and could be [confirmed](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7566041/libor-death-notice-could-be-served-this-year-fca) later this year – will not just affect the portfolio directly, but also every process and system that currently references a Libor rate. Over the past year, PGGM has been conducting what Pasma calls an “x-ray” to identify all of these little, hidden Libor-[dependencies](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6966336/libor-switch-spells-trouble-for-loan-systems).

Some turned up in unexpected places – for example, in a formula used by PGGM’s human resources department to calculate deferred employee bonuses. Others were where you would expect. The principal challenge was that there were lots of them.

“It’s your entire fixed income operation and the back office where you have to value them; actuarial models, where you have to calculate liabilities and the present value of liabilities; all your valuation models where you perform discounted cashflow modelling; your risk proxies, because you’re using some model with a risk-free rate component; your quant and factor strategies that might have an interest rate component; scenario modelling, where some of your scenarios incorporate interest rate shocks. And so on,” says Pasma.

In all, he says, PGGM has more than 100 systems with some form of Libor or Ibor reference. For most cases, the fix is easy – a link to the outgoing Libor or Euribor rate will be replaced by its successor benchmark and the system will continue working almost seamlessly. That’s not true everywhere and Pasma says the firm has “spent a considerable amount of time” working out which models would break when the old reference rate disappears.

On the clearing front, PGGM and other European pension funds currently have [an exemption](https://www.risk.net/regulation/6181776/uk-pension-funds-may-have-to-clear-post-brexit) from the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, which requires users of many interest rate swaps to send their trades to a central counterparty (CCP). Politicians sought to protect the sector after [hearing concerns](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/2309661/fear-the-repo-funds-face-up-to-rate-contingent-liquidity-risks) that keeping a stock of liquid assets on hand to meet daily margin calls would erode pension returns – or could, in the case of severe stress, force funds to try and liquidate some investments.

The exemption is due to expire in mid-2021. PGGM has begun clearing some trades – pushed that way by market forces rather than regulation – but the [old complaints](https://www.risk.net/infrastructure/clearing/1810757/pension-funds-worried-about-ccp-margin) haven’t gone away.

“Even if you have an exemption, when fewer and fewer banks want to trade with you OTC but they do want to trade cleared, then you don’t really have a choice,” says Pasma.

He adds: “For us, it’s an increased liquidity risk. One of the strengths of pension funds is that they can be relatively illiquid and they are long-term investors, but if you have this huge derivatives book – and you have to clear it – then it makes you a short-term investor, because you have to keep so much in cash to meet variation margin calls.”

But perhaps the incoming changes to the Dutch pension system will enable PGGM to run a smaller derivatives book. Because the system is dropping the pretence of guaranteed returns, it is also expected to drop the rekenrente – the single discount rate.

“It will, most likely, be based on forward-looking returns on a portfolio level – instead of a single risk-free curve, but the details have to be figured out,” says Pasma.

Dutch pensions specialist Cardano has been trying to figure out some of those details. Roel Mehlkopf – a pension fund adviser with the firm in Rotterdam – says the expectation is that there will be less demand for ultra-long-dated interest rate hedges, while inflation hedging could increase.

“The reason is that in the new system, you can determine interest rate hedges separately for each age group. At the moment, you have one big funding ratio and you might hedge 50% of your exposure to it. In the new pensions contract, you can have a higher hedge ratio for the elderly – to give them a stable outcome – but a lower one for younger generations if you believe hedging is not in their interest. If that’s what happens, then hedging will be more focused on shorter horizons – 10, 20 and 30 years,” he says.

### Neglected risks

Will the pandemic also have a lasting impact? Pasma believes so.

“Something we have to learn is that people had been warning about the risk of a pandemic for many years – and we chose, collectively, to ignore it. That makes you think about other signals we have chosen to ignore,” he says.

Climate change fits the bill – a risk Pasma believes is being underestimated, rather than ignored – but he has other neglected exposures in mind, tool.

“I’m thinking about technology and robotisation and the huge number of jobs that will be replaced. What will happen there? And other mega-trends, such as mass migration, big demographic changes, and other negative impacts of technology change. Ultimately, these things will result in certain industries and companies being very successful, and others being unsuccessful. And we are investors in all of these companies today, so we need to know about these risks,” he says.

Perhaps this is the trade-off for a pension fund CRO. When markets go into freefall, they have a slightly easier ride than a hedge fund risk manager – they won’t be overseeing frantic attempts to hedge a failing strategy, rapidly liquidate a portfolio, or placate jumpy investors. Their performance over a week, a month, or even a quarter is not going to make or break them. But as that horizon extends, the risks that need to be measured become far more awkward – a greater degree of [uncertainty](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7552516/covid-scenarios-finding-the-worst-worst-case) creeps in.

Pasma seems to have made his peace with this: “I very much believe that if you are a long-term investor, you should really know and understand what risk factors are driving your portfolio. Good risk management is not only about quantification, having flashy models. It’s also about common sense, sitting together with your investment strategists and especially – most importantly – having an open mind about the stories that until now we’ve chosen to ignore.”
