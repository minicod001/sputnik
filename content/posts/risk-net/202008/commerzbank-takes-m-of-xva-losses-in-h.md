Adjustments to the valuation of derivatives (XVAs) cost Commerzbank €111 million ($132 million) over the first six months of the year. A year ago, these added €71 million to revenues.

Credit, debit and funding valuation adjustments (CVA, DVA and FVA) took €160 million out of first-quarter income as credit spreads widened, elevating the risk of counterparty defaults and pumping up the cost of funding margin payments. These same adjustments added €49 million to second-quarter income, though, as spreads tightened again.

Commerzbank said foreign currency movements in relation to its subordinated debt, together with certain legacy items, also contributed to the €111 million charge.

Derivatives assets held for trading totalled €47.6 billion, and derivatives liabilities €45.4 billion at end-June, up 21% and 20% on end-December, respectively.

Hedging derivatives assets amounted to €2.3 billion, up 17% on end-2019 and liabilities €5.9 billion, up by a third over H1.

Commerzbank reported a €74 million loss overall for the first half, with a positive operating result of €309 million for Q2 partly offsetting the €278 million loss incurred in Q1.

### What is it?

[Credit valuation adjustment (CVA)](https://www.risk.net/definition/credit-valuation-adjustment-cva) is a change to the market value of a derivatives instrument to account for counterparty credit risk. It represents the discount to the standard derivatives value that a buyer would offer after taking into account the possibility of a counterparty’s default.

[Funding valuation adjustment (FVA)](https://www.risk.net/definition/funding-valuation-adjustment-fva) is the cost that arises when a dealer is unable to directly pass variation margin from an out-of-the-money client to an in-the-money client. The dealer then has to fund the margin itself, generating a cost.

[Debit valuation adjustment (DVA)](https://www.risk.net/definition/debit-valuation-adjustment-dva) is an adjustment to the value of an outstanding derivatives contract to account for a bank’s own credit risk. It applies mainly to uncollateralised swap liabilities, becoming more positive as a bank’s creditworthiness deteriorates and becomes more negative as it improves.

### Why it matters

Positive XVA swings over the second quarter have helped a number of banks back into profits. For example, [JP Morgan](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7654996/jp-morgan-posts-510m-xva-gain) posted a $510 million gain because of the adjustments for the second quarter.

Others haven’t been as fortunate. [HSBC](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7662701/hsbc-trading-unit-hit-by-355m-of-xva-costs-in-h1), for example, reported further XVA losses over the second quarter.

The composition of a bank’s derivatives portfolio has a big influence over its XVA volatility. A book full of uncollateralised swaps, with risky counterparties, will incur larger costs and benefits than one where the majority of exposures are margined and struck with creditworthy names.

Those firms that continue to see XVAs eat away at their earnings through this period of volatility may consider enhancing their hedging programmes, or shuffling more exposures through a central counterparty.
