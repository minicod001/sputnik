Top US dealers’ liquidity risk gauges projected a larger amount of deposit outflows over Q2 compared with Q1. This implies that deposits have become a greater source of funding risk over the course of the coronavirus crisis because of clients bulking out their accounts.

Cash outflows, which firms subject to the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) use to calculate the amount of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) they need to comply with the rule, increased 6% in aggregate across the eight US global systemically important banks (G-Sibs) to $3.15 trillion in Q2.

Projected non-operational funding outflows, largely made up of deposits by corporates and financial institutions that are not earmarked for day-to-day needs, increased 12% over the quarter to $817.2 billion, and now make up almost 26% of total cash outflows, compared with around 21% at the end of 2019.

Estimated operational deposit outflows, consisting of working capital and cash held to cover transactions, increased 13% to $499.6 billion over the quarter, and make up 16% of total outflows, up one percentage point from end-2019.

Each of the eight G-Sibs bar Wells Fargo saw estimated non-operational funding outflow amounts increase quarter on quarter. JP Morgan posted the largest increase, in dollar terms – $30 billion (+19%). Wells Fargo’s projected outflows shrank by $10.5 billion (-13%).

JP Morgan also saw operational deposit outflows estimates climb the most over Q2, by $22.2 billion (+16%).

In aggregate across the systemic banks, cash outflows related to derivatives exposures and collateral requirements increased the most, in dollar terms, quarter on quarter – by 26%, to $259.1 billion. Outflows tagged as for “other contractual obligations” fell the most, in percentage terms – by 16% to $14 billion.

### What is it?

The [LCR](https://www.risk.net/topics/liquidity-coverage-ratio-lcr) is one of two liquidity ratios introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the wake of the financial crisis, the other being the net stable funding ratio.

The LCR is calculated as the ratio of a bank’s stock of high-quality liquid assets – mainly cash and government bonds – to net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period. Banks are required to maintain this ratio at a 100% minimum.

US bank LCR disclosures show both the total amount of cash outflows expected over a 30-day period and the amount after the application of run-off factors. The latter amounts are those used in this article.

### Why it matters

A [dash for cash](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/banks/7529666/us-banks-leverage-soared-in-q1-before-feds-reprieve) among corporates and financial institutions alike early on in the coronavirus crisis left top banks groaning under the weight of deposits. It looks as if comparatively few firms have since put that cash back to work in non-deposit accounts since March. JP Morgan, for instance, recorded a net $95 billion (+5%) increase in deposits over Q2 alone.

This increase to banks’ cash piles is a mixed blessing at best. On the one hand, thanks to intervention by the [US Federal Reserve](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/banks/7529666/us-banks-leverage-soared-in-q1-before-feds-reprieve), the excess reserves and US Treasuries the banks must hold to back these deposits are not affecting their leverage-based solvency requirements, meaning they’re ‘free’, from a capital perspective.

On the other hand, by demanding matching HQLA in the first place, the deposits force banks to dedicate a huge chunk of their asset portfolios to low-yielding cash and securities, which isn’t helpful to profitability.

If the economy improves, it’s likely the G-Sibs will try to tempt clients to shift their deposits, especially their non-operating deposits, which attract high run-off values under the LCR, into ‘stickier’ investments that don’t demand the same quantity of HQLA.
