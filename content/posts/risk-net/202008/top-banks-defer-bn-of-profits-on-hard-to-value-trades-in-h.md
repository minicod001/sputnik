Leading European dealers set aside hundreds of millions of ‘day-one’ profits on the sale of structured products and complex derivatives over the first six months of the year to reflect valuation uncertainty.

In aggregate across seven top banks that disclosed their so-called ‘deferred margins’ on these trades, reserves on new transactions totalled €1.6 billion ($1.9 billion) over the first half, compared with €928 million the year-ago half. In addition, the amount of deferred margin released back into income over the first six months of this year was substantially higher than the year-ago half: €1.3 billion compared with €1 billion.

Reserve balances at end-June – the total amount of set aside ‘day-one’ profits net of releases into income – came to €3.1 billion, up 12% on end-December 2019.

Swiss lender UBS reported the largest percentage increase in deferred margin reserve over this period – a 66% rise to €216 million.

Natixis posted a 23% increase to €150 million, HSBC a 22% spike to €79 million, Crédit Agricole a 18% rise to €78 million and BNP Paribas a 15% jump to €904 million. Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale reported smaller increases, of 9% and 4% to €480 million and €1.2 billion, respectively.

Over the first half of 2020, BNP Paribas set the most profits aside on new transactions – €532 million. Of this total, €312 million was linked to sold equity derivatives.

### What is it?

When a bank uses unrecognised models and/or unobservable market data to value a financial instrument, it is recognised on the income statement at its transaction price and any additional profit implied from the valuation technique on the trade date is deferred.

These reserved profits gradually flow into banks’ coffers over the lifetime of the trade, according to methods unique to each one.

Instruments that fall into this category include structured products, asset-backed securities and complex derivatives, as well as certain private equity holdings, structured repo trades, and illiquid loans and bonds. Firms subscribing to IFRS accounting standards disclose deferred profits as part of their financial statements.

### Why it matters

Screwy markets, upset by the coronavirus crisis, made valuing derivatives-linked products tricky over the first half of the year. Whole portfolios of assets became impossible to price using market inputs, forcing banks to classify billions as [marked-to-model](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7659741/mark-to-model-assets-spiked-at-eurozone-banks-in-q1).

This at least in part explains the steep increase in new margin over this period. Compared to last year, banks are far less confident about how much they stand to make off the sale of complex trades, as if markets behave erratically, as they did over March and April, expected profits could be rapidly eaten up through hedging losses and other effects.

The heightened uncertainty may also explain why at some banks very little deferred margin was transferred to income over the first six months. At Societe Generale, only €10 million was released, and at Deutsche Bank just €9 million. This could be because the banks’ models weren’t prepared to allow reserves to be depleted given the prevailing conditions.
