Nomura is rebuilding its foreign exchange sales and trading team in New York following the return of volatility to the markets and is refocusing its global business around Asian pairs and FX options.

The Japanese bank slashed headcount in the US [in April last year](https://www.fx-markets.com/foreign-exchange/4174561/nomura-to-downscale-g10-fx-business-in-1-billion-cost-cutting-drive) following a review sparked by its poor fixed income performance at the end of 2018. But as volatility [has picked up](https://www.fx-markets.com/our-take/7524381/who-revived-fx-volatility), the FX business’s revenues have revived.

Rig Karkhanis, deputy head of global markets at Nomura, says that with volatility expected to stick around, it made sense to rebuild the US team.

“We were confident that there is a following with our US client base, and we felt for a variety of other reasons that if we reopen the desk and invest in it, we are likely to expand upon our following,” says Karkhanis.

On the trading side, Mick Tyndall has returned to Nomura as an executive director for FX options trading, having spent the past two-and-a-half years as head of flow FX options trading at Barclays. Nicky Lam, a former trader at Goldman Sachs and NatWest Markets, has joined as a senior options trader in Asia to manage Nomura’s yen book globally.

Chirag Garg, who was an FX forwards trader at HSBC, will also join shortly, along with two other traders from Nomura in Singapore.

On the sales side, Matt MacLeod, a former head of multi-asset sales for the Americas at UBS, and Chris Melvin from JP Morgan, have joined to oversee FX sales in New York, along with two other salespeople who will transfer from Nomura’s London office.

The combination of external hires and internal transfers will give the bank a team of eight people in New York when complete.

At a global level, the business will be more focused on its specific strengths. Given the bank’s heritage, one of them will be Asian currency pairs. With the increasing focus on best execution, Karkhanis says clients were increasingly happy to look past the largest dealers to more niche players in certain markets.

“With many of our clients remaining sticky with us – particularly in the US – while we were downsizing, we realised that theme will only continue over the next few years. So even for mid-size players like us where we have a narrower product focus, I think there’s definitely a seat at the table,” he says.

G10 and emerging markets options will be the other key focus. Karkhanis says the bank has a “healthy risk culture” and a very strong yen and Asian options franchise, while Europe has also been one of the better-performing books.

Karkhanis adds that the bank has a long history in the Japanese retail FX structured products market, which includes embedded options that provide flows to the bank that it can hand off to clients in the wholesale market.

“This time around, we’re really trying to focus on our strengths,” he says. “As we refocus our global FX business, particularly in the US and Europe, what we’ve tried to do is narrow our product focus and leverage areas where we believe we have an edge.”

Nomura is also expanding the range of FX products available on its single-dealer platform, NomuraLive. The existing platform is heavily focused on cash products but the bank is improving its capabilities in non-deliverable forwards, options, FX forwards and structured products.

“The reality is we were very much behind in terms of what we had and the back-end architecture of the product,” Karkhanis says. “Soon we’re going to entirely redesign the client experience, and I’m confident in a year’s time it will be a best-in-class product.”
