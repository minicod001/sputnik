The severe recession sparked by the coronavirus pandemic has caused the creditworthiness of US insurers’ high-yield bond portfolios to deteriorate, which may pump up their risk-based capital requirements.

As of end-2019, insurers held $227.5 billion of junk-rated debt, data from the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://www.naic.org/capital_markets_archive/special_report_200828.pdf) (NAIC) shows. Of this, about 59% was designated NAIC 3, which covers bonds with an S&P credit rating of BB+ to BB-.

The shutdown of the US economy following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic has since caused credit rating agencies to [downgrade](https://www.risk.net/comment/7562771/scared-of-fallen-angels-so-are-the-rating-agencies) huge amounts of outstanding corporate debt. As of August 17, S&P alone had taken 1,975 negative rating actions on these instruments.

NAIC analysis suggests 9% of NAIC 3 bonds transitioned to an NAIC 4 designation (equal to an S&P rating of B+ to B-) or lower between end-2019 and June of this year. Around one-quarter of NAIC 5 bonds (rated CCC) were downgraded.

This suggests the overall riskiness of insurers’ high-yield debt piles have increased, though the NAIC analysis did not take into account potential trading activity undertaken by firms over this period.

Ratings downgrades sufficient to lower the NAIC designation of a bond increase the risk-based capital (RBC) charge required of the carrying insurer. The NAIC analysis therefore implies that RBC charges have likely gone up across the universe of surveyed firms.

Certain types of insurers were more exposed to the riskiest bonds than others. NAIC 5 bonds made up just 9% of life insurers’ total high-yield holdings, and 8% of property and casualty (P&C) firms’. However, they accounted for 17% of title insurance companies’ holdings.

Overall, high-yield instruments made up 5.1% of US insurers’ total bond portfolios as of end-2019.

### What is it?
The [NAIC’s Capital Markets Bureau](https://www.naic.org/members_capital_markets_bureau.htm) “monitors developments and trends in the financial markets generally, and specifically with respect to the insurance industry”. It publishes periodic specialist reports to regulators and the public, offering insights into issues that could affect insurance company investment portfolios.

### Why it matters
Though junk-rated bonds make up just a fraction of insurers’ total asset holdings, they could have an outsized influence over their capital allocation and investment plans if the coronavirus-induced recession deepens.
Mass downgrades of high-yield bonds will force capital requirements higher, and may incentivise those insurers with especially large holdings to dump their portfolios. This could set off a round of fire-selling that lowers the value of every insurers’ bond allocation and depletes their capital.
