Buy-side preparations for Libor’s widely anticipated demise are progressing at a snail’s pace in parts of Asia, due largely to inaction by local regulators, according to asset managers and banks in the region.

Asset managers in Hong Kong are “actually quite behind the curve”, says a senior Hong Kong-based executive at a US asset management firm, adding: “The regulators need to take a much more proactive approach.”

The same observations are made by four banks active in the region. They say they have been working extensively with their buy-side clients to help them transition to new reference rates, but that their efforts alone have not been enough.

“For banks it is probably easier to wrap their heads around it, because of the regulators pushing and sending CEO letters to the banks,” says Chordio Chan, head of investment at Bank of China (Hong Kong). “Banks are being regulated by the central banks. [But] for customers, there is nobody pushing them. That offers them the moral hazard that, ‘well, we can afford to wait and see’.”

It is widely expected that some Libor rates will not be published beyond 2021, once regulators stop compelling banks to submit quotes to the rate-setting panel. Once this happens, firms with Libor exposures will have to switch to an alternative reference rate.

In Hong Kong and many other parts of Asia, this will often be the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), the replacement for US dollar Libor. The world’s reserve currency is ubiquitous in local Asian markets – for example, tens of billions of dollars of floating rate notes linked to US dollar Libor are [issued](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7658756/asia-debt-market-suffers-sofr-inertia) in Asia every year.

Libor in its various local iterations is a forward-looking rate, which allows a user to know their interest payments in advance. SOFR, however, currently has no forward-looking term structure. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a US industry group, [is seeking to develop](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7425721/fast-track-sofr-term-rate-says-jp-morgans-pluta) such a forward rate, possibly using SOFR futures, prior to Libor’s cessation.

“My feeling is that [buy-side] customers are hoping cessation will be postponed or that [the market] will come up with an in-advance SOFR product,” Chan says.

Using an in-advance benchmark rather than one with a backward-looking term structure would reduce the need for asset managers to overhaul their systems.

“If I put in all the resources to make the changes, then somehow they come up with an in-advance model – then all that effort has been wasted,” Chan says.

This kind of dithering has been harder in Europe and the US, where regulators have been actively pressuring and cajoling the buy side to move away from Libor.

For example, in January the ARRC, which is backed by the Federal Reserve, [released a checklist](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Microsites/arrc/files/2020/ARRC_Buy_Side_Checklist.pdf) for how the buy side should implement the transition to SOFR. And, in February, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority [wrote](https://fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/dear-ceo-asset-management-libor.pdf) to the chief executives of all UK-regulated asset management firms, setting out what it expects them to do ahead of Libor’s disappearance.

By contrast, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, which regulates the asset management industry, has nothing on its website that addresses the benchmark’s all-but-inevitable death. The commission declined to say whether it planned to provide any guidance on the transition.

The advice that does exist has come from an unexpected place: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which regulates banks, asked the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Asifma) to develop an Ibor transition guide for financial institutions in the region. The resulting [paper](https://www.asifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/asifma-aplma-icma-isda-ibor-transition-guide-for-asia.pdf) was published in July.

The HKMA has also worked with Hong Kong’s Treasury Markets Association on an explanatory [note](http://www.tma.org.hk/FixingsFile/LIBOR_Transition_Points_for_Corporate_Treasurers.pdf?203) about the benchmark reform, aimed at corporate treasurers. In a July [letter](https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/guidelines-and-circular/2020/20200710e1.pdf?172) about the reform, sent to the chief executives of the banks it regulates, the central bank requested that the banks distribute the TMA [note](http://www.tma.org.hk/FixingsFile/LIBOR_Transition_Points_for_Corporate_Treasurers.pdf?203) to their corporate customers “to impress upon them the need to make early preparations”.

The guide produced by Asifma together with other industry groups is targeted at financial institutions in general and contains no specific advice for asset managers, while the pointers in the TMA note amount only to two short paragraphs.

Bank of China’s Chan says that, while the HKMA is trying to encourage buy-side firms to learn more about the transition to risk-free rates through such measures, they are not subject to the same regulatory pressure to transition as banks.

“This ensures clients receive the necessary information. However, at the end of the day, it’s down to the client whether they treat these educational material seriously,” he says.

Besides detailed and targeted guidance, the buy side in Asia also needs direct engagement from regulators and firm-specific advice, according to banks and others in the financial industry.

“The simple fact is that the transition consists of two sides. You cannot force the transition just by putting pressure on one side,” says Terry Yang, a finance partner at law firm Clifford Chance.

Buy-side firms also need clarity on how alternative risk-free rates, including SOFR, should be used in product valuation – something many do not understand, despite banks’ work on this with their clients, he adds.

A senior risk manager for a large regional bank in Asia says: “At some stage [Asian] regulators have to start approaching the buy side as well, and identify those players who do need more guidance.”

The senior Hong Kong-based executive at the US asset management firm says Asian regulators also need to do more to promote local alternative benchmarks. He says local Libor replacement rates should be developed both by industry associations and the authorities.

“What if the industry comes up with a solution that regulators are not comfortable with? Regulators need to provide input from a regulatory perspective. It’s not realistic to expect the buy side and the sell side to come together and say, ‘let’s do XYZ’. Libor transition is a change of market structure,” he says.
