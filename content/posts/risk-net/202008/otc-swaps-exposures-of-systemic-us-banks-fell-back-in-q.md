The US’s systemic banks saw their over-the-counter swaps exposures to counterparties of all kinds dip over the three months to end-June, after spiking dramatically over the first quarter of the year.

Net current credit exposures, those from derivatives that are in-the-money to the bank, amounted to $620.4 billion in Q2, down 15% on Q1, when they were at their highest level since public disclosure began six years ago. Exposure amounts remain elevated on their end-2019 level, however.

Over the second quarter, exposures to hedge funds fell sharpest, by 42% to $23.4 billion. Morgan Stanley had the greatest amount of exposure to these counterparties in Q2, with $5.3 billion. Still, this was less than half of the exposures it reported for Q1.

Aggregate exposures to corporates fell 22% to $295.7 billion. JP Morgan carried the most exposure, with $68 billion, down about 13% quarter-on-quarter.

Net current credit exposures to bank and sovereign counterparties declined only slightly over the second quarter in aggregate, by 5% and 3%, respectively.

As aggregate exposures fell, so did the amount of collateral retained by the banks to secure themselves from counterparty default. Total collateral amounted to $617.9 billion in Q2, down 12% on the prior quarter. This was equivalent to 99.6% of net current credit exposures, implying the banks were slightly undercollateralised. In Q1, the coverage ratio was 95.5%. It was the first time a sub-100% ratio had been reported since Q2 2016.

### What is it?

FR Y-9C forms, submitted to the Federal Reserve on a quarterly basis, are used to assess and monitor the financial condition of US banks.

Banks have to report their net current credit exposures on OTC derivatives by counterparty type, calculated as the fair value of a derivatives contract when that fair value is positive. The current credit exposure is zero when the fair value is negative, or zero. Where a legally enforceable bilateral netting agreement is in place between bank and counterparty, the fair values of all covered contracts with that counterparty are netted to a single amount, which may be positive, negative, or zero.

### Why it matters

Banks’ pay-floating interest rate swaps would have moved sharply into-the-money in Q1, as central banks the world over cut rates. This would explain part of the build-up of net current credit exposures. Other directional trades would also have ballooned in value as markets tumbled – especially purchased credit protection and equity swaps.

The decline in exposures over the three months to end-June could reflect the normalisation of markets and resetting of hedges. Some banks may even have paid clients to unwind deep in-the-money swaps so they could strike new agreements that lowered their exposures.

The data also shows that the spike in exposures exceeded the influx of collateral over Q1. Possibly this was because the fair value of non-cash collateral declined over the period in response to the market tumult. Whatever the reason, banks carried a certain amount of uncovered exposures in Q1, which left them vulnerable to losses in the event of counterparty defaults. It’s noteworthy that this collateral gap all but closed over Q2, likely the product of banks’ margin models adapting to the volatility unleashed earlier in the year.
