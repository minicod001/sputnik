This is the eighth in a series of articles connected to our buy-side risk survey. Click [here](https://www.risk.net/topics/buy-side-risk-survey-2020) to read the rest of the series.

Nasreen Kasenally started preparing her firm for a pandemic long before Covid-19 entered the global vocabulary.

When UBS Asset Management’s chief risk officer launched that work three years ago, she was not thinking about the spread of an incurable virus. Instead, she and her team had their eyes on a confluence of factors that would ultimately play a part in the stress faced by investors in March: capital and liquidity rules had helped contract dealer balance sheets, investors were pouring more money into the biggest asset managers and algorithmic trading had become increasingly dominant, at least in equities.

“We expected we would have a liquidity crunch one way or the other,” says Kasenally. “We just did not know how big it would be, when it would be, and what would trigger it.”

The team re-examined its risk framework, working with the head of investments to identify and then stress-test “hotspots” – concentrations in particular sectors, strategies or individual positions that had the potential to become severely illiquid under stressed conditions.

It then reviewed and updated what Kasenally calls a “liquidity crisis playbook” for all of the funds run by the $928 billion-asset firm, outlining procedures and chains of command for liquidity issues that “cannot be resolved by what would be viewed as normal day-to-day portfolio management activity”.

When the crisis broke in March, communication and co-ordination was among the first things to change. Kasenally and her team began meeting more frequently, and also working more closely with their front-office colleagues.

“I personally got involved on a daily basis with what was happening on the investment side,” she says. “I was having daily calls with the head of investments and all the heads of the businesses. I also had calls with our head of client coverage to understand the real-time flows.”

Many of these scheduled calls stayed in the calendar for at least the next two months. They included daily conversations within the risk team and daily calls with staff across the business for portfolio, liquidity and risk updates. Kasenally also took part in biweekly calls with the executive team and the chief risk officers of other UBS divisions.

The period represented “one of the largest liquidity crunches I’ve seen in my career – even beyond 2008”, she says.

### Quick decisions

Thanks to the firm’s work on liquidity risk, it may have been prepared for that crunch, but there were still surprises, still decisions that had to be taken quickly.

In one case, increased volatility was pushing some portfolios close to their [value-at-risk](https://www.risk.net/investing/7659866/why-investors-are-stuck-with-flawed-var-models) limits. Ordinarily, decisions on whether to increase those limits might take weeks, says Kasenally. In March, the firm didn’t have that kind of time.

“We had to decide on the buffer we were happy to have versus the regulatory limit. We looked at positions of fund, performance and opportunities and decided to increase the internal limit,” she says.

Some of the surprises related to the degree of stress in particular asset classes or instruments – or to the interactions between them. As stocks and commodities plunged in the first half of March, for example, ordinarily liquid markets [seized up](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7505206/us-treasury-market-holds-its-breath-after-high-drama) – including, briefly, US Treasuries.

The fixed income market proved especially [challenging for investors](https://www.risk.net/investing/markets/7536811/electronic-bond-trading-stalled-in-volatile-markets) and Kasenally says the team had difficulty finding tradeable prices on screen. In the credit space “hardly anything was trading” at one point, says Kasenally. With few trades going through, it was harder for UBS AM to be sure what some of its positions were worth.

“We saw valuation challenges, especially for fixed income products. We spent some time working really closely with the valuation team, the portfolio managers, and the traders to really get some more providers,” she says.

That meant working with portfolio managers to source additional dealer quotes. Kasenally notes the firm was never unable to quickly value funds or positions.

As the coronavirus spread beyond China in February, the team had begun running scenarios to gauge the impact of equity market declines, investor flight to quality, and credit spread widening, but the extent of the widening in bid/offer spreads was another shock.

“The big surprise was not how much the market moved, but how illiquid it became,” she says.

UBS AM was not alone in this respect. In Risk.net’s buy-side risk management [survey](https://www.risk.net/investing/7658331/before-and-after-the-covid-19-storm-buy-side-risk-survey), more than half of respondents (54%) said credit market liquidity [did not meet](https://www.risk.net/investing/risk-management/7654516/preparation-paid-off-for-funds-during-covid-liquidity-crunch) their expectations. Respondents reported a similar experience in commodities markets (53%), but said equity, FX, and rates market liquidity largely met expectations.

### Using the playbook

UBS AM’s risk measures may not have been right when anticipating the size of the impact, but they were directionally correct, and Kasenally says those results spurred the right kind of conversations.

“It’s very rare that you will be able to model exactly a stress event. What’s important is that you model something that is in the same direction as what happens and gets everyone around the table talking and really consciously agreeing that your positioning makes sense and if we go through a stress event then we’re all comfortable with that,” she says.

As volatility increased during March, Kasenally decided to subject some portfolios to the UBS AM liquidity crisis playbook, meaning they would face a stricter decision-making protocol. Kasenally says the decision was more of a pre-emptive “dry run” before liquidity issues developed, allowing the firm to get used to the coordination needed in high-stress periods.

“It increased awareness across the different functions and their respective roles,” she says.

As a result, the team has since made adjustments to the playbook, including updating the voting members, developing a back-up process for the Asia divisions to handle situations in their respective time zones, and adding a reputational risk assessment.

Those changes come on top of a standard battery of assessments the firm uses to gauge market and liquidity risks, including redemption models, historical and hypothetical stress tests, and VAR models. It looks at risk sensitivities including duration for bond portfolios, factor risk for equity portfolios, tracking error for passive strategies, and second-order sensitivities, known as Greeks, in options books.

Most Risk.net survey respondents reported running historical or hypothetical stress tests on their portfolios. Nearly half of respondents said hypothetical and historical testing were “somewhat useful” to help them navigate the March selloff. Hypothetical tests were seen as “very useful” by 38% of respondents – slightly more than the 32% who said the same of historical tests.

Kasenally says the firm’s risk management philosophy is to address exposure at both a fund and a firm level. One way to do this is to look at concentrations and ensure funds maintain a diverse investor base – while simultaneously ensuring the firm as a whole is not overly focused on certain sectors or credit ratings, or reliant on similar strategies for too much of its revenue.

Kasenally, who until 2017 worked in a variety of market risk roles for UBS’s investment bank, says controlling risk at the asset manager is a very different proposition, and is more complex than telling a market-making desk to cut exposure.

At UBS AM, the pre-pandemic liquidity planning led to discussions between the risk and investment teams to assess whether the positioning made sense given current and potential market environments – and, crucially, the needs of the firm’s clients.

“Looking at hotspots in some funds helps you position proactive discussions with the portfolio managers to ensure concentrations are understood and accepted, that they are in line with the investment guidelines, and will provide the desired returns for clients,” says Kasenally.

Today, five months after the pandemic turned financial markets upside down, the firm is still running some of its business-wide updates – due mostly to the fact that teams are working remotely – and is not looking to permanently retire them. The plan is to revive the updates if a stress indicator – for example, the Vix index of equity options volatility – hits a certain level.

And Kasenally sees other ways for the firm to improve its risk management. It is currently working on updates of its stress scenarios and liquidity modelling.

Plans to make some changes puts UBS Asset Management in line with the majority of survey respondents. Those with changes in the offing said they would apply more severe stresses in tests, introduce concentration limits or adjust their existing set of concentration limits.

Still, one-third of respondents do not plan to make changes as a result of volatile markets earlier in the year. Kasenally finds that difficult to imagine – regardless of how well a firm was able to weather the storm.

“Even though I have over 22 years of experience in the industry, with every stress event I’ve learned something new. A good risk manager should always look at what has just happened and learn how to make things better,” she says.
