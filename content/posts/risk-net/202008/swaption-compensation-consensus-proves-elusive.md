{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_ECB-sponsored recommendations fail to rally market behind compensation exchange solution_{{< /quote >}}

The euro swaptions market hit a milestone in late July when long-planned changes to the discount rate at clearing houses led to knock-on adjustments in the valuations of related derivatives.

But despite regulator-backed recommendations that any losses should be compensated on a voluntary basis, many users are unwilling to participate in a potential voluntary compensation exchange.

In its recommendations for the [discounting switch](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7527801/clearing-houses-postpone-euro-discounting-switch-to-july), the European Central Bank-led euro risk-free rates working group said a third-party infrastructure service could handle the switch.

Capitalab, a trade compression service, claims to have such a solution. The only fly in the ointment is that for the service to work, it requires market-wide adoption – and even as the valuation changes occur, consensus on whether to use Capitalab is no closer.

“We are reluctant to participate [in the Capitalab service] unless everyone on my counterparty list agrees we will go that way. And we’re not only talking interbank, we are also talking about the client side,” says a head of global rates trading at a European bank.

In Europe, the rate clearing houses use to discount the present value of future cashflows for swaps – and for calculating interest on posted margin – switched from Eonia to €STR on July 27.

As swaptions take their value from the underlying interest rate swaps, this resulted in a valuation change. In a similar move, cleared US dollar interest rate swaps will shift from the federal funds rate to SOFR on October 16.

Clearing houses have agreed to square off winners and losers for the impact the discounting switch will have on the value of existing euro and US dollar swaps. But as swaptions are traded bilaterally, [no similar compensation](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7547201/swaptions-compensation-method-divides-market) mechanism exists.

The Capitalab service, which seeks to solve this problem, has two steps. The first is called a bilateral zero-compensation run. The idea is to reduce gross P&L exposure in the portfolio.

It involves swaptions that do not yet specify a discount rate. Within this group of trades, Capitalab can identify a subset that are deemed to be offsetting. Capitalab then changes those trades so they reference €STR-discounted swaps, reducing gross P&L exposure between counterparties and removing uncertainty on the labelled trades.

To date, €290 billion ($340 billion) has been switched to specify €STR as the discounting rate, with 11 entities involved. This same step can be applied to US swaptions affected by the planned US dollar swap discount switch from federal funds to SOFR in October.

The second step requires consensus among participants. If enough of the market is involved, Capitalab can run the same exercise across the residual portfolio.

There are two possibilities regarding compensation exchange. Cash compensation can be exchanged without changing anything other than the agreed discount rate field on the swaption trade – though this would come with a small change in exposure to swaption Greeks.

Or, the notional and strike of each swaption trade can be changed slightly, so there is no risk, no P&L effect, and no cash compensation is exchanged.

“We’ll see if there is a consensus among the participants as to whether they want to go to step two or not,” says Gavin Jackson, co-founder and managing director at Capitalab.

In order to prevent users in step two of the process from only putting forward trades that would attract compensation – or cherry-picking – Jackson says all participating firms would have to submit their whole portfolio.

“The entire inventory has to go in. That would be a prerequisite. And it would involve a highly extended pairing phase. That’s how we would tackle the cherry-picking issue,” says Jackson.

### All for one – and two?

For the second phase to work, Jackson estimates it would require roughly 80% of the market to get involved. This is because firms may be net long or short to different counterparties, so the more that are involved, the fairer the final compensation amounts will be.

Both the US alternative reference rates committee and the ECB risk-free rates working group have recommended the payment of compensation on a voluntary basis.

The US committee advised counterparties to contact each other by June 30 to discuss the discounting switch and compensation exchanges on a portfolio basis.

Some believe there is a role for Capitalab, but argue the actual changes should be done bilaterally.

“I would think, if Capitalab is to do anything, it would just provide a facility for the calculation of the number. I think it’s up to each bilateral pair of counterparties to agree what to do commercially,” says the head of credit valuation adjustment at a large US bank.

Market consensus has been hard to find with regards to compensation exchange, particularly because it remains a voluntary exercise. Some dealers fear they may lose out if the interdealer market agrees to pay back windfall gains to losing counterparties, but clients in the offsetting trades decline to do so.

“If there is going to be a disparate response between dealers – and between clients and dealers – where does that leave the whole recommendation? To me this is a critical issue,” says a swaptions head at one large dealer.

Some others disagree with the working groups’ recommendations, but fear going against them.

“I think a working group that’s arguably not representative, and taking a recommendation from that, would potentially open you up to all kinds of problems,” says a swaptions trader at a US bank. “That said, of course, nobody wants to be seen not to be supporting it.”

Given the complexity and sensitivity of the compensation exchange debate, some bankers are concerned over the effect it may have on client relationships.

“If half of my clients don’t want to give compensation because they’re out-of-the-money, it will be difficult for me to go through a legal process and challenge that. And then, of course, the other half of my clients – assuming I’m a bank and net neutral – will say, ‘I need compensation’. Then it would be a relationship discussion about whether we lose relationships because we have to pay out when we haven’t received money from the guys who owe us,” says the head of global rates trading at a European bank. “I just don’t see how that conundrum will solve itself.”

The US bank swaptions trader suggests the path of least resistance is to let the contracts play out as written. And if users want to bilaterally negotiate, they can do so.
