Eurozone insurers restarted bond purchases in the second quarter after selling billions in Q1, but continued to offload equities, even as a rally in global stock markets helped push up the value of their portfolios.

Data from the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pdf/icb/ecb.icb2020q2_annex~f0b4d241a3.en.pdf?d2f9ce5bf8654a7f4811c0f09d5c29fa) shows that insurers’ assets hit €8.72 trillion ($10.42 trillion) as of end-June, up 3% on end-March, having fallen some 3% over the first quarter. Net purchases of debt securities amounted to €15.1 billion over Q2, compared to net sales of €5.8 billion the previous quarter.

The total value of bonds held by insurers totalled €3.57 trillion, up 3% on Q1. Holdings of private sector debt issued by eurozone entities increased fastest over the quarter, by 4% to €1.16 trillion.

Over the three months to end-June, insurers sold a net €1.9 billion of listed equities, on top of the €82 million sold in Q1 and €1.6 billion in Q4 2019. Still, rising valuations helped pump up insurers’ total public equity holdings 10% over the quarter to €201.9 billion.

The value of investment fund shares held by insurers also appreciated meaningfully over Q2, by 6% to €2.3 trillion. Net purchases of fund units amounted to €10.6 billion over the quarter, their lowest going back to Q4 2018.

### What is it?

The ECB’s [statistical warehouse](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pdf/icb/ecb.icb2020q2_annex~f0b4d241a3.en.pdf?d2f9ce5bf8654a7f4811c0f09d5c29fa) publishes eurozone insurer statistics. Key variables are available at a monthly frequency, while more details are provided quarterly.

### Why it matters

Debt securities make up by far the largest portion of insurers’ asset portfolios, accounting for 41% of the aggregate total in Q2. It stands to reason that some insurers, spooked by the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis, sold off riskier bonds they thought may default in Q1, but bought them back in the following months after the ECB helped soothe markets through its [corporate sector purchase programme](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/cspp-qa.en.html) and other measures.

One reason firms continue to sell off listed equities, meanwhile, may be that they have transitioned to using investment funds, included exchange-traded funds, to gain exposure to publicly-traded shares instead.
