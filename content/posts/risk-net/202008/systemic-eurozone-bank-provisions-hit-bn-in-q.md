The eurozone’s too-big-to-fail banks put €10.8 billion ($12.7 billion) aside for loan-loss reserves in Q2, in anticipation of a wave of defaults triggered by the ongoing coronavirus crisis. This was 11% higher than the amount taken in Q1.

Of the eight systemic lenders, ING’s loan-loss provisions increased the most quarter-on-quarter, more than doubling to €1.3 billion. Huge charges were also taken by Groupe BPCE, which set aside €981 million in Q2, 95% more than in the prior quarter, and Societe Generale, which reserved €1.3 billion, an increase of 56%.

Santander and UniCredit were the only systemic lenders to incur lower provisions charges in Q2 than in Q1. At Santander, Q2 loan-loss provisions were 21% lower than for the prior quarter, at €3.1 billion, while at UniCredit they were 26% lower, at €937 million.

Expressed as a percentage of outstanding loans, however, Santander took the biggest provisions hit of the group. Its ratio of provisions to loans amounted to 1.26%. Groupe BPCE posted the lowest ratio, of just 0.55%.

### What is it?

Provisions for credit losses are taken out of income each quarter to cover expected shortfalls in payments from loans and other credit instruments.

### Why it matters

Loan-loss provisions are sized using lenders’ forward-looking macroeconomic scenario models. With the world economy still in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic, the forecasts produced by these models have become gloomier.

Some banks have also taken [add-on charges](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7660101/ifrs-9-and-the-loan-loss-lottery) to account for the uncertainty surrounding their model outputs.

Looking ahead, some bank executives told analysts they expect to take smaller provisions in the coming quarters, as most of the reserves needed to cover pandemic-induced losses have now been built up. Still, a lot depends on European countries maintaining progress containing the virus and reopening their economies.

If and when the economy normalises, banks could still see provisions spike again if government support measures, like loan repayment holidays and state guarantees, are phased out. To keep the banking system humming, policymakers would be well advised not to dismantle the support systems put in place to prop up the economy any time soon.
