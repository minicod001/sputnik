In spite of the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis in March, European Union lenders’ probability of default (PD) estimates for corporate borrowers fell in Q1 2020, [regulatory data](https://eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/risk-dashboard) shows.

The mean average weighted PD for corporate exposures, as gauged by EU banks for counterparties across 39 countries, was 1.92% in Q1 2020, down from 2.14% in the previous quarter and 2.24% a year prior. The mean average weighted loss given default (LGD) estimate was 35.75%, up from 34.92% on the quarter and 35.16% on the year.

Corporate PDs ranged from 0.57% for South Korean counterparties to 8.05% for Greek borrowers. LGD values were lowest for Danish corporates, at 22.47%, and highest for Chinese companies, at 48.23%.

In contrast, credit risk estimates for retail exposures edged higher quarter-on-quarter. The mean average weighted PD for these was 2.03% in Q1 2020, up from 1.91% three months prior though still below the 2.31% recorded the year-ago quarter.

The mean average weighted LGD estimate for retail exposures was 25.88%, compared with 25.87% in Q4 2019, and down from 26.28% in Q1 2019.

Swedish retail borrowers attracted the lowest average weighted PD estimates, at 0.36%, and Greek borrowers the highest, at 16.21%. Retail LGD values were lowest for Maltese debtors, at 9.77%, and highest for Indian debtors, at 53.17%.

### What is it?

The [European Banking Authority](https://eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/risk-dashboard) produces quarterly credit risk parameters, based on data provided by EU banks that use internal-ratings based approaches. The disclosure is intended to increase transparency on the default rate, loss rate, PD and LGD of the retail and corporate counterparties of EU banks.

PDs are computed as a weighted average of non-defaulted exposures. Only statistics for countries with more than three banks reporting in that particular country are shown.

### Why it matters

Economic lockdowns to prevent the spread of Covid-19 took effect only near the end of the first quarter, so it’s not surprising that banks’ PD and LGD estimates did not abruptly surge higher. In fact, the data suggests lenders went into the crisis with loan books filled with highly creditworthy assets, which puts them in a better position to withstand the ongoing fallout of the pandemic.

PDs and LGDs may have degraded since, as the extent of the Covid recession has come into focus. However, the numerous [state guarantees](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7511896/eu-banks-eye-bad-loan-relief-from-state-guarantees) and stimulus measures endorsed by EU countries may prevent these credit risk parameters degrading too much, and in turn stop banks’ credit risk-weighted assets from lurching higher.

Such an outcome would soothe policy-makers, who are pinning the hopes of an economic recovery on lenders’ capacity to continue extending credit to businesses through the crisis.
