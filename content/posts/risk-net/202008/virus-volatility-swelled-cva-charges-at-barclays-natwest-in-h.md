Capital charges to cover credit valuation adjustment on over-the-counter derivatives surged at top UK banks over the first six months of the year. Barclays alone saw its CVA charge climb 58% over the period.

CVA risk-weighted assets (RWAs) at the bank amounted to £3.9 billion ($5.1 billion) at end-June, translating to a capital requirement of £316 million – up from £200 million at end-December. Exposures subject to the CVA treatment increased less than 10% to £17.8 billion over the period. The bank said the RWA uplift was due to the volatility of credit spreads and a rising dollar.

NatWest’s CVA RWAs surged 26%, to £2.3 billion, over the first half. The bulk of the increase was due to the step-up of the regulatory multiplier applied to its RWAs in response to several value-at-risk backtesting exceptions.

This was offset somewhat thanks to capital relief introduced by the [Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7661886/natwest-reaps-benefits-of-pras-market-risk-relief), which allows banks to offset RWA increases caused by multiplier add-ons by deducting an equal amount from market risks-not-in-VAR (RNIV).

HSBC stood out among the country’s lenders in that it reduced exposures subject to the CVA framework over the first half, along with RWAs. The former shrank 4% to $34.2 billion, and the latter 7% to $3.7 billion.

At Standard Chartered, CVA RWAs climbed $480 million (+23%) to $2.6 billion and at Lloyds £45 million (+8%), to £629 million.

### What is it?

[CVA](https://www.risk.net/definition/credit-valuation-adjustment-cva) is an adjustment to the market value of derivatives instruments to account for counterparty credit risk. It represents the discount to a derivatives’ value that a buyer would demand after taking into account the possibility of a counterparty’s default.

European rules require banks to set aside an amount of capital to shield against CVA losses, calculated using a regulator-set standardised approach or internally-modelled advanced approach, or a mix of the two.

### Why it matters

Regulatory CVA capital charges are driven by a variety of factors: the size and creditworthiness of a bank’s counterparty roster, its use of hedges, foreign exchange movements and credit spread volatility, to name a few.

The application of regulatory multipliers is another. At NatWest, because the CVA multiplier was primarily responsible for pumping up its capital requirement, the bank benefited most from the PRA-allowed adjustment to RNIV. Barclays, which said the credit spread volatility of its counterparties was the main driver, did not get to offset its CVA charge as much this way.

The flip side, of course, is that NatWest could see its CVA charge spike once the relief expires in September if it continues to incur VAR breaches.
