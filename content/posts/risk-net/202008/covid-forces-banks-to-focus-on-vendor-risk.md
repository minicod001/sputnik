The economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic has spurred banks to increase due diligence of vendors that provide critical outsourced services – while at the same time making audits of such firms difficult, and on-site inspections impossible.

Companies are scrutinising everything from the financial well-being of their third-party suppliers to their ability to switch to other providers, should their primary ones fail. This is all the more important in an environment where on-site inspections are non-existent.

“For a lot of third parties, working from home is a foreign concept,” said Nasser Fattah, managing director of cyber security, IT and third-party risk at MUFG, during a [Risk.net webinar](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/2472596/534966057D87075291918D222E30A345/1222994?mr=s) on August 5. “Third parties [would] have a significant impact if they were to experience a breach, so you need to have a dialogue with critical vendors.”

Amid instances of outsourced service providers [buckling under demand](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7519431/op-risk-data-outsourcing-losses-loom-in-lockdown) during the pandemic, financial firms are closely monitoring the ability of vendors to weather the economic downturn and maintain critical operations. In some cases, banks say they’ve stepped in to support vendors in obtaining government permission to continue operations in-office, with key worker designations.

Banks are also scrutinising the controls that vendors maintain for managing their data – and who has access to it – in a critical light because of the threat of external parties or [inside employees](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7517326/virus-weakens-banks-defences-against-internal-fraud) gaining access to sensitive data. The possibility of unauthorised access to networks is creating the need for additional levels of scrutiny of a vendor’s policies for managing employees working remotely.

“You need to have good working relationships with third parties and minimise ways they access your environment. Insider threats from a third party [are] hard [to manage], so you need awareness and education,” said Jörgen Mellberg, chief information security officer and head of IT at Sparbanken Syd in Sweden, during the webinar.

With on-site inspections at times impossible during lockdown, companies are paying closer attention to information regarding the financial health of suppliers. For public companies, they are poring over audited statements to determine their credit standing, sources of liquidity and available capital.

It’s also important to determine the degree to which third parties are dependent on or owned by other suppliers, such as the big tech firms, banks point out.

“[Relationships with] Microsoft and Apple could be 80% of a small [vendor’s business]. Concentration raises the risk level. Go through the financial statements and try to determine if they have concentrations within their own business,” said Joseph Iraci, head of financial risk management at TD Ameritrade, during an earlier [webinar](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/2472385/1099E87DFF3736DCC4D231FA3DA26DA8/1222994?mr=s) on August 3.

Given the possibility of a critical supplier becoming unavailable or insolvent, having a replacement strategy is crucial. Firms are assessing the criticality of the products and services they source externally with a view towards either switching to another provider or bringing services in-house.

With the difficulty of conducting financial assessments of vendors that are privately held, and the inability to do on-site inspections, firms need to understand the risks inherent from an incomplete audit and be prepared to apply additional scrutiny once they’re able to get back on-site, operational risk executives say. In some cases, companies are making do with minimal audits, sometimes as simple as running a webcam through data centres.

Firms should be prepared to help their critical suppliers get over the hump, such as sharing their security awareness programmes to educate third-party personnel on best practices for controlling cyber risk, said MUFG’s Fattah.

“If you have an effective security awareness programme, you should consider extending it to your third party, because their success is your success,” he added.
