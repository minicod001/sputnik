ABN Amro halved the amount of regulatory capital charged for its uncollateralised derivatives exposures over the six months to end-June through the use of credit default swap hedges.

The Dutch bank bought €125 million ($147 million) of notional protection through credit default swap index (CDX) derivatives in the first half of the year to offset its credit valuation adjustment (CVA) capital requirement, which is charged to cover the risk of its derivatives counterparties collapsing. CVA charges have increased at many top dealers in recent months as default risks have spiked in response to the coronavirus crisis.

The hedging programme means that although exposures that attract CVA charges at ABN remained broadly unchanged at end-June from end-2019, at €1.1 billion, the associated risk-weighted assets (RWA) for these fell 48% to €192 million. This translates to a risk density of just 17%, down from 33%.

### What is it?

[Credit valuation adjustment (CVA)](https://www.risk.net/definition/credit-valuation-adjustment-cva) is a change to the market value of a derivatives instrument to account for counterparty credit risk. It represents the discount to the standard derivatives value that a buyer would offer after taking into account the possibility of a counterparty’s default.

Under current Basel III regulations, banks are required to hold capital against CVA. Under European Union rules, these charges do not apply to derivatives with non-financial corporate counterparties.

### Why it matters

Hedging CVA is a tricky business. Credit derivatives can be used under European Union rules to negate CVA capital charges without pumping up market RWAs. However, the [accounting effects](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7540951/credit-agricole-natixis-unicredit-pummelled-by-xva-losses) of CVA, which can eat into revenues, are driven by foreign exchange and interest rate movements, as well as by credit spread movements. Hedging these is tougher, as under EU rules those instruments offsetting the non-credit aspects of CVA are not exempt from market risk charges.

ABN Amro prioritised hedging the capital implications of CVA through the newly-bought portfolio of CDX, saving some €15 million in capital charges in the process over the first half. Market RWAs shrank over Q2, too. This could mean the bank did not hedge all its accounting CVA, unlike [Natixis](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7662856/natixiss-market-rwas-grew-49-over-q2), and therefore avoided a surge that could have cancelled out its CVA RWA savings.
