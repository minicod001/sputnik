Major central banks are scaling back their seven-day dollar swap operations, backstopped by the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200320a.htm), in recognition that their banking systems are no longer short of the greenback.

[Today](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/august/us-dollar-liquidity-providing-operations-from-september1-2020), (August 20) the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank said they would reduce the frequency of the seven-day operations to once a week, from three times a week. In March, seven-day operations were [conducted daily](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7512741/japan-banks-seize-on-us-dollar-funding) to ensure non-US banks had sufficient access to dollar funding at the height of the coronavirus crisis.

The decision to cut down on the operations follows comes in the wake of demand for the dollars offered through the facility. Since July, the four central banks have tapped the Fed for $33.4 billion in aggregate. In June, they borrowed $81.7 billion and in May $45.3 billion.

In March, when the coronavirus pandemic first broke out, the banks borrowed a whopping $216.1 billion.

Outstanding borrowed amounts across all central banks with access to the dollar swap lines, across all borrowing maturities, totalled $95.8 billion as of August 13, down 79% from their peak on May 27.

The Bank of Japan has the most dollar borrowings outstanding, accounting for 80% of the total as of August 13.

### What is it?

The dollar facilities offered by the ECB, BoJ, BoE and SNB are underpinned by swap lines provided by the Fed, which, in principle, have no upper limit. The Fed first established dollar liquidity swaps in 1994, but expanded the lines during the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank of Canada has access to a swap line, but has never drawn on it.

On [March 15](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315c.htm), the central banks agreed to lower the price on the standing US dollar liquidity swap arrangements by 25 basis points, so that the new rate is the US dollar overnight index swap rate plus 25bp.

On [March 20](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200320a.htm), they upped the frequency of seven-day maturity operations from weekly to daily, starting from March 23 and lasting till the end of April at least.

On [June 19](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200619~8badb7725d.en.html), the central banks reduced the frequency to three times a week, starting from July 1. Twelve-week swap operations will continue to be offered once a week.

### Why it matters

The joint decision to slow down seven-day swap operations is indicative of a loosening of dollar funding markets after they [seized up](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7508641/banks-rush-to-tap-new-dollar-liquidity-facilities) in March. The Bank of England stopped drawing amounts though the seven-day facility after July 22, and outstanding amounts borrowed by the ECB are down 94% from their peak.

The Bank of Japan is the only party to the Fed swap lines that has drawn on them in bulk since May. This likely reflects [Japan banks’](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7512741/japan-banks-seize-on-us-dollar-funding) gargantuan holdings of US dollar assets, and their need to fund them on a continual basis.
