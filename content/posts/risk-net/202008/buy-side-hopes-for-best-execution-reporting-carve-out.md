{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_After EC exempts venues from best execution reporting, Aima hopes RTS 28 reports will be next_{{< /quote >}}

The European Commission’s proposed rollback of best execution reporting has left some wondering why the carve-out stopped short of the buy side’s reporting obligations.

The [proposed amendments](https://ec.europa.eu/finance/docs/law/200724-mifid-review-proposal_en.pdf) to the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid II), published on July 24, include a two-year suspension of the quarterly best execution reports compiled by trading venues and systematic internalisers.

Intended to reduce the administrative burden and aid the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, the EC proposal states that these reports – known by their regulatory designation, RTS 27 and detailing price, costs, speed and likelihood of execution for various financial instruments – are “rarely read by investors”.

The same arguments, however, can be made about the best execution reports the regulation requires buy-side firms to publish, says Adam Jacobs-Dean, global head of markets, governance and innovation at hedge fund lobby group, the Alternative Investment Management Association (Aima).

“Investors don’t use them and they don’t actually enable any meaningful comparison across investment managers,” he says.

The buy-side version of RTS 27, known as RTS 28 reports, require regulated investors to disclose annually their five most used counterparties across cash and derivatives instruments and the proportion of trading each of those counterparties comprises. There are no plans, though, to suspend the RTS 28 reporting requirements, says an EC spokesperson.

The real beneficiaries of the RTS 28 reports, says Jacobs-Dean, are the brokers, who can use them to see their standing with particular clients.

“It does prompt people to roll their eyes, because it takes a lot of time. They’re aware they are disclosing information that pretty much no-one will look at, bar potentially the broker community, because they have an incentive to see where they stand in the pecking order,” he says.

The best execution reports [have long been seen](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6302776/investors-bemoan-mifid-ii-best-ex-failings) as challenging to access and analyse, and broader problems with the data publication requirements under Mifid [have plagued the regulation](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7649641/improving-mifid-post-trade-transparency-splits-markets).

An [industry survey](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4718200/Cappitech%20MiFID%20II%20&%20Best%20Execution%20Industry%20Survey.pdf) last year by compliance and regulatory technology firm Cappitech found 72.4% of respondents were not using RTS 28 reports to make trading decisions. More than half of respondents were not reviewing other firms’ RTS 28 data.

In its 2019 [disclosure](https://www.artemisfunds.com/en/gbr/adviser/resources/rts-28-execution-venues), UK-based Artemis Investment Management said it had reviewed RTS 28 [disclosure](https://www.artemisfunds.com/en/gbr/adviser/resources/rts-28-execution-venues)s from other firms “simply to ensure we are following a content and format similar to other managers – hence providing consistency to clients”. The firm said it “could not conclude anything meaningful” from the broker and trading venue reports.

The EC acknowledged in its proposal that buy-side firms receive information relevant to their best execution strategies in ways other than the RTS 27 reports, such as through meetings with their brokers. It said it would review whether the requirement to publish these reports should be removed permanently or if they needed to be revised.

RTS 28 also requires investors to explain how they use the data execution venues and systematic internalisers disclose as part of their RTS 27 reports. So even without a carve-out for the RTS 28 reports, some buy-side firms may still be encouraged by the suspension of the broker reports, especially if their review of them did little to enhance their best execution strategies.

“It’s potentially problematic if you’re supposed to do something with the information but find it so meaningless that you can’t,” says Aima’s Jacobs-Dean. “I think there would be plenty of firms that would be relieved in some ways if RTS 27 reports weren’t being published because it takes away at least one obligation to do something with that information.”

In March, the European Securities and Markets Authority [encouraged](https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma35-36-1919_esma_statement_on_covid-19_and_best_execution_reports.pdf) national regulators to allow brokers and investors to publish RTS 27 and 28 reports after their respective deadlines, citing the upheaval caused by the pandemic.

### “Meaningful relief”

The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (Afme) welcomes the EC’s most recent proposal. “A temporary suspension of RTS 27 will provide meaningful relief, because those reports are not really useful to investors,” says Pablo Portugal, a managing director in Afme’s advocacy division.

“We don’t think there’s going to be any detriment to investor protection or meaningful loss of information by suspending that requirement.”

Jacobs-Dean says there is still potential for the RTS 28 reports to be reviewed – either in discussions around the latest EC proposal or in the broader Mifid II review slotted for next year. The EC proposal has to make its way through EU legislative channels before either set of reports are officially suspended.
