Top European banks’ trading loss estimates surged over the three months to end-June. Of the seven systemic eurozone lenders that reported figures for Q2, the mean quarter-on-quarter increase was a whopping 61%.

BNP Paribas posted the highest average trading value-at-risk (VAR) amount for Q2, with €54 million, an increase of 54% quarter-on-quarter. Deutsche Bank’s came in a close second, at €43 million, up 79%.

ING posted an average of €39 million, up 82%. Societe Generale’s increased 54% to €40 million, and Crédit Agricole’s 45% to €16 million.

Natixis – the investment banking subsidiary of systemic French lender Groupe BPCE – saw its VAR climb 113% to €18 million.

Spanish giant Santander was the only systemic bank to see its VAR dip over the quarter, by 3% to €15 million.

### What is it?

Value-at-risk measures the potential loss due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon to a specified confidence level.

The VAR output used for internal management purposes differs by bank.

Because each bank sets the parameters and sensitivities of its VAR model differently, and use their own historical data as inputs, VAR model outputs are not comparable between firms.

### Why it matters

Higher VAR amounts typically translate into increased market risk capital charges, which can erode the return on equity of banks’ trading units if they don’t bring in bumper revenues.

European banks had a harder time making money in Q2 than their [US rivals](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7656221/trading-risks-lurched-higher-at-top-us-dealers-in-q2). For some, like [Societe Generale](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7662706/socgens-var-jumps-54-in-q2), complex structured products [dragged on earnings](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7663541/socgen-mulls-sale-of-structured-product-books-after-big-losses), prompting efforts by management to offload the troublesome portfolios.

While slimming down and simplifying trading operations may be a surefire way to lower VAR and market risk capital charges, it also risks depriving banks of big profits when the economy rebounds.
