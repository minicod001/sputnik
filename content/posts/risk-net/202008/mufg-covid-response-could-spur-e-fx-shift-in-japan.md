In Japan, before Covid-19 arrived on the scene, if you wanted to trade the foreign exchange markets you had to turn up at the office. The country’s megabanks and many other financial institutions operated within a culture where being physically present was as important as the amount of work done. They simply didn’t allow trading from home.

But that all changed post-March, when organisations had no choice but to give their traders the option of homeworking. At the height of the crisis roughly 70% of FX staff at MUFG were working at home, though that figure has since fallen to around half.

The fact that the traders can work from home at all is testament to the work done by MUFG to build – almost from scratch – an IT framework that would allow it. It wasn’t just that the bank didn’t previously allow traders to work from home – they physically couldn’t access core parts of the system if they did so.

“Before Covid-19 it was not common for liquidity providers in Japan to work from home, but that situation has now changed dramatically,” says Naoto Nakamura, global head of FX and local markets trading at MUFG.

“We had to adjust ourselves to be able to operate based on work-from-home principles. We didn’t change everything, but we changed enough so that we could continue to provide an efficient service, irrespective of whether staff were working from the office or from home.”

Preparation for homeworking began in March, shortly after Covid-19 hit, and most of the bank’s core systems were accessible by home traders by April 8, when the Japanese authorities declared a nationwide state of emergency. Nakamura says MUFG now wants more of its systems to be accessible from home.

The most important thing, he says, is that working-from-home procedures adhere closely to the bank’s internal code of conduct. This has meant introducing a new supervision framework – including regular monitoring of communications – at employees’ homes as well as at work, to make sure that all transactions are in line with the company’s standards.

“We needed to very carefully assess which products would be suitable for home trading,” says Nakamura. “It was more feasible for electronic trading, but less feasible for spot traders to execute large size tickets. It also depends on the speed and stability of the network connection.”

For those trades that couldn’t be safely executed at home – such as large-ticket spot trades – MUFG maintained a core staff in the office that could execute them.

Nakamura says one consequence of trading from home – and the operational safeguards that banks put in place to guarantee market resilience – is that traders were less prepared to take risk, which removed some of the liquidity from the market. This was also stated on a June 22 conference call run by the heads of the Global FX Committee, and while some banks privately dispute this, Nakamura says it’s been a reality at his firm and others.

“[Having] a large part of market participants working from home reduced the risk appetite of traders,” says Nakamura. “As a result, we felt that the function of traders as shock absorber got weaker. This caused the market to become choppier with less liquidity in March.”

Reduced risk appetite included taking smaller tickets and holding risk for shorter periods. In practice, the latter means they’ve been looking to hedge client trades in the interdealer market quicker than would ordinarily have been the case, which can result in bigger market impact.

### Liquidity support

MUFG is the largest financial conglomerate in Japan, with just over ¥311 trillion ($2.94 trillion) on its balance sheet as of March. Its FX business handles the full spectrum of FX spot and derivatives products, including forwards, swaps, options and non-deliverable forwards.

The currencies traded are predominantly yen and Asian emerging markets, with yen being the largest segment. MUFG has a wide diversity of clients, both within Japan and overseas, including corporates, asset managers, regional banks, hedge funds, retail aggregators and life insurance companies.

While MUFG does not disclose the size of its FX business, it is in the good graces of group chief executive Kanetsugu Mike, who in the firm’s 2019 annual report said that foreign exchange is an area of focus for the bank in the wake of slumping equity and credit markets.

Nakamura is also chairman of the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Committee, which seeks to make currency trading in the country safer by issuing warnings during times of market stress or just before public holidays, when liquidity is likely to be constrained.

For instance, on March 27, the committee warned that markets might exhibit greater volatility as participants sought to execute larger-than-usual FX trades during end-of-month benchmark fixings. Nakamura says this warning worked well and stopped market participants taking on undue risk.

Nevertheless, he says, trading conditions were extremely difficult in March as liquidity vanished from markets around the world at once.

“This is perhaps the first time in the past 20 years that the real economy all around the world has been damaged at the same time,” says Nakamura. “As people reduced their risk exposure to the market, we tried to figure out how to best support our clients to provide liquidity, even in these conditions.”

Nakamura points out that having consistent access to the FX markets is hugely important for large swaths of the economy: the asset class is used to drive investment returns in a low-yield environment, as a hedging tool for companies and as a funding tool for global investors. This is why being able to continue offering high levels of liquidity to the market, even during times of stress, is so important.

“Providing liquidity is fundamental to supporting the market itself and vital for the market to be healthy,” says Nakamura. “For some markets in March, especially emerging markets, this was really quite difficult – market volumes and depth were quite thin and buckling under the strains of significant volatility.”

When Covid hit, many local clients had difficulties because of the widening bid/offer spreads in many currencies – particularly in emerging markets but also across the G10 pairs.

“If the market participants wanted to transact a large amount, the additional cost was significant compared to before Covid-19, and at the same time the liquidity was not there,” he says, adding that markets have since returned to normal.

### Electronic dreams

Nakamura believes the long-term impact of Covid-19 in Japan will go far beyond merely tweaking the operational parameters for allowing staff to work remotely. He says it is also likely to encourage more clients to transact online as they become accustomed to trading from home.

Japan is often considered to be one of the world’s more advanced markets for electronic trading, but according to Greenwich Associates this is vastly distorted by the retail market. According to its data, while 87% of total FX trading volume in the market is executed through electronic systems, if retail aggregators are stripped out the total e-FX share of the market is actually just 45%. Meanwhile, total e-FX trading in the US stands at 73%, while in Europe the figure is 68%, according to Greenwich.

“We think electronification in the Japanese market – except for retail brokers or retail aggregators – still has some room to grow,” says Nakamura.

But Covid-19 may have given the e-FX market the added push that was lacking previously: “The change in business strategy that has come about because of Covid-19 increases the need among our customers for electronification of FX, so we need to watch closely how our clients and their behaviour will change. We believe that electronification will give our clients more benefit, not only in access to FX services but also in more convenient, tailored services based on data analysis,” he says.

Long before the pandemic struck, MUFG was already upgrading its technology to improve the online experience for clients that trade FX electronically. However, as Nakamura says, the pandemic has served as a reminder of the need to keep updated with technology.

One area that is ripe for development at the bank is the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) within currency trading. MUFG already crunches through petabytes of big data to define the most optimal FX trading strategies, but the Japanese bank is now looking to take that technology further into market-making.

Banks such as Credit Suisse are already using this technology to [forecast FX market movements](https://www.risk.net/awards/7187461/currencies-flow-market-maker-of-the-year-credit-suisse) a few minutes into the future. Nakamura is coy about MUFG’s plans but says the bank has had various AI projects in the pipeline for a few years, adding that the Covid-19 situation has given them greater impetus.

“This isn’t a new area – we’ve been looking at involving AI in market-making for some time now – but it takes time for it to be fully functional,” he says.

### Platforms on parade

Asia has been seen as the laggard when it comes to the buy side adopting algorithms to execute spot FX trades. But Nakamura says algo execution among his buy-side clients has been growing steadily recently, and he believes greater electronification of the market will intensify this trend.

MUFG is also taking a closer look at the platforms on which it trades spot FX. Citi made headlines recently after the results of analysis it carried out persuaded the US bank to slash the number of external spot trading platforms it connects to [down to five](https://www.fx-markets.com/tech-and-data/7652691/citi-to-focus-on-just-five-fx-spot-platforms).

Nakamura declines to say whether MUFG will follow suit, but says the firm is analysing which platforms are important for clients.

Looking to the future, Nakamura believes the pandemic will have a significant impact on how clients trade the FX markets, particularly in terms of how technology solutions are deployed and the growth of electronic trading.

He says greater pockets of e-trading and the use of new technologies such as peer-to-peer networks could create the additional liquidity that the market needs – providing it is correctly handled.

“This is part of a longer-term shift. I think market participants are still in the process of adjusting themselves to the new norm and we are trying to fit our processes to this. No one has yet figured out exactly what the picture will eventually look like, but it is certain that people will have more options and flexibility for trading FX – and safety is paramount.”

### Buy-side buy-in

Another thing that is close to Nakamura’s heart is the adoption of the FX Global Code, the set of principles that were introduced in 2017 to foster good practice among participants in the currency markets without the need for new legislation.

A key goal of the FX Global Code is to persuade more members of the buy side to sign up to its principles. Nakamura says that around 10 buy-side firms in Japan have signed up so far, but these have mainly been the larger or medium-sized asset managers. No insurance firms or corporates have added their names as yet.

“We are sure that greater buy-side adherence to the code would elevate this side of the market and prove to their stakeholders that they are engaging with a higher level of standards,” he says. “Once buy-side market participants understand that the code is indeed good for them and their business, more of them will start using it.”

Last year, the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market Committee visited some major buy-side firms to raise their understanding of the importance and benefit of adhering to the code. As a result, Nakamura says, more people are now expressing an interest in how they can take the next step.
