{{< quote steelblue >}}_Buy-side risk survey: top executive talks about learning from Daniel Kahneman and client behaviour_{{< /quote >}}

This is the ninth in a series of articles connected to our buy-side risk survey. Click [here](https://www.risk.net/topics/buy-side-risk-survey-2020) to read the rest of the series.

A year ago, the international business of Federated Hermes set up what the firm called the “bear market council” where portfolio managers would dream up outlandish scenarios and discuss how to test their investments against them.

The idea comes from a book by the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist and economist Daniel Kahneman, says Eoin Murray, head of investment at the unit, which manages assets from institutional and financial intermediary customers outside the US.

“In that book, Kahneman relays his experience of being a grunt in the Israeli Defense Forces,” Murray explains. “They would sit in their little platoons of 10 and they would all come up with their wackiest, least likely, but highest-impact risk. Then, as a group, they would rank the risks. And the one that scored lowest – that is, was deemed to be the most improbable – was the one that they spent most time focusing on.”

The thinking behind the council at Federated Hermes is the same, says Murray, whose role includes independent oversight of investment teams.

“What you’re essentially doing is acknowledging that the other risks are there in our subconscious and we probably are contemplating them, but the risk that we all dismiss is the one that you really want to be worried about.”

The plan was for the council to meet on a quarterly basis, but it did not get into full swing before the Covid-19 pandemic rocked markets earlier this year – something Murray regrets.

“I’m now more determined that it should become a firm fixture for us,” he says. “Through that group, we will keep challenging ourselves to think: what are the risks that we are not thinking about in the mainstream and we should be modelling or attempting to model and come up with scenarios that we can then stress-test our portfolios against.”

At the root of this focus on tail risk is an established belief at the firm that, in Murray’s words, “the normal distribution doesn’t model financial assets particularly well”.

“The most interesting parts of the realised distribution of asset returns are in the tails and have a bigger impact than Gaussian assumptions would have you believe,” he says.

But even without a fully fledged bear market council, risk managers at his unit run a gamut of hypothetical and historical stress tests and at least on a monthly basis send the resulting reports to portfolio managers.

“We think of risk as the multi-headed Hydra. At best, you can get close to understanding different elements of it but it’s very difficult to get a single metric that gives you the entire picture,” Murray says.

The expectation is then that portfolio managers will “read and digest” the analytics, but they are not obliged to make changes, he adds. The long-term nature of their holdings “does put a slightly different slant on how we would expect our teams to interpret information and determine whether changes were necessary to their current portfolio”.

Turnover for positions in equities, fixed income and private markets is measured in years, not months, with equity investments, for example, often held for six or seven years, Murray notes.

The 2019 [annual report](https://services.federatedinvestors.com/teamsite-file-server/content/corporate-annual-report%2F2020AR.pdf?token=ZGFmXHBkZlxjb3Jwb3JhdGVfYW5udWFsX3JlcG9ydFwyMDE5LWFubnVhbC1yZXBvcnQucGRm%7C1%7CMCwCFDOSZc0orBM4ro8trf5BChT4iY8TAhQvW8FRvqegCmzXIjhoeo84CClTLw%3D%3D) of Federated Hermes shows that, at the end of last year, 80% of its managed assets in the international client market were equities, alternative and private assets, and bonds, while shorter-term, highly liquid money market assets made up 20%.

In this, the unit – which includes activities carried out by Hermes before the investment manager combined with Federated Investors – differs from the company’s other two businesses: the unit servicing US institutional clients and that servicing US financial intermediaries, whose customers are often retail investors. In each of those two businesses, money market assets amounted to 75% of their assets.

According to an analyst [update](https://services.federatedinvestors.com/teamsite-file-server/content/about-federated%2F.pdf?token=ZGFmXHBkZlxhYm91dF9mZWRlcmF0ZWRcMTctNjk3NTIucGRm%7C1%7CMCwCFGbfZkP5qORoP5GKG1NNkVZM%2B00QAhQaOJ1TKPZ77nEwm5ccOjlx3ghDPg%3D%3D) on June 30, the international business manages $64 billion or 10% of Federated Hermes’ assets.

### Two-sided risk

As part of its suite of stress tests, the firm’s international business runs regular liquidity stress tests. Murray says these assume trading conditions will be significantly constrained. The tests measure the time it would take to liquidate portfolios without incurring excessive trading costs. Likewise, according to a recent Risk.net [survey](https://www.risk.net/investing/7658331/before-and-after-the-covid-19-storm-buy-side-risk-survey), time and cost to exit positions are the most common measures used in buy-side liquidity stress tests.

Although the same methodology is applied to gauge liquidity across all instruments, Murray says data used in the analysis varies depending on its availability – for instance, in credit data is less available than in equities, so there is a greater reliance on modelling.

When evaluating liquidity both under normal and stressed conditions, likely redemptions are also considered, based on the nature of the firm’s funds and client concentrations.

“Liquidity risk is two-sided,” Murray explains. “It’s not just about the asset side of your balance sheet. It’s also about the liability side. We like to have where possible a non-concentrated, diverse client base – a mix of clients with different return objectives and time horizons.”

[Redemption modelling](https://www.risk.net/investing/risk-management/7503006/funds-try-to-predict-behaviour-of-mystery-investors) will become compulsory for fund managers in Europe from September 30 as part of a new liquidity stress-testing regime.

Although the fund sector is not entirely new to redemption modelling, the practice has so far been confined mostly to the biggest firms. The new rules will require all managers to consider various combinations of possible outflows and asset sales for each fund, since even a fund with liquid assets may not be able to sell enough of them quickly enough to meet mass redemption requests.

The market selloff in March shone a light on the importance of liquidity risk. According to the Risk.net survey, it was the biggest source of risk for 35% of respondents, up from 4% in normal times. Another 39% ranked it second in March, behind investment risk.

Liquidity, as well volatility, were the biggest concerns for Murray at the peak of the Covid-19 turmoil. But as the firm went into the crisis with “good liquidity” across its portfolios, portfolio managers did not have to make dramatic changes to meet redemptions, he says.

{{< img src="/img/FederatedHermes_03.png" float="float" orientation="right" marginLeft="15px" marginTop="15px" marginBottom="15px" marginRight="15px" width="350px">}}

“It was more about careful analysis of where best to source liquidity for redemptions from, while also focusing on how we wanted to be positioned during [the crisis] and for the post-crisis world,” Murray adds.

Even though stock markets quickly fell into a bear market, he says there “wasn’t a huge amount to be done” on the equity exposure in the international unit, which consists solely of long physical positions.

“Some of the teams had allowed a little bit of cash, perhaps more than normal, to build up possibly in expectation that, irrespective of the pandemic, certain assets were beginning to look a bit stretched,” Murray notes.

In fixed income, the funds he oversees are more complex, relying on a variety of instruments to achieve desired positions, but they mostly transact in liquid bonds with high credit ratings.

One risk for the firm during March was that clients would look to empty these highly liquid holdings. “Clients that were under pressure themselves would quite often come to us to raise cash, which creates its own turnover,” Murray says.

This highlights a potential disadvantage of investing in liquid assets: although such holdings can be vital in a crisis, they can also influence the behaviour of investors – by leading them to tap or change their investments more frequently.

Drawing on academic research, a senior fund manager argued exactly this in a 2018 [blog post](https://behaviouralinvestment.com/2018/12/12/is-there-a-behavioural-premium-for-illiquid-investments/). Joe Wiggins at Aberdeen Standard Investments, trained in behavioural science, said daily liquidity and easy access to investments forced investors to review their investments “perpetually”.

“Market movements incite an often overwhelming temptation to act, which technology and liquidity facilitate, increasing the potential for behavioural mistakes,” Wiggins wrote.

Federated Hermes does not break out its flows by client market, but publishes [data](https://www.federatedhermes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8K04302020.pdf) on the company as a whole. In the first quarter, its equity funds – that is, excluding separate accounts – recorded net outflows equivalent to 0.9% of their assets. Net outflows from Federated Hermes’ fixed income funds equalled 4.2% of their assets. For regulated open-end equity and bond funds globally, net outflows stood at 0.1% and 1.9% respectively, according to [statistics](https://www.ici.org/research/stats/worldwide/ww_q1_20) from the Investment Company Institute.

Including separate accounts, net equity outflows at Federated Hermes amounted to 2% of equity assets and net fixed income outflows came up to 2.5% of bond holdings.

Overall, the company rode out the market chaos in March, with earnings per share and managed assets rising in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2019. Barring the development of the bear market council, Murray says he is not planning any changes in risk management practices for now.

But he cautions: “I think we’re not truly finished with this pandemic crisis yet.”
