{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Buy-side risk survey: how asset managers weathered the liquidity crisis in March_{{< /quote >}}

This is the fifth in a series of articles connected to our buy-side risk survey. Click [here](https://www.risk.net/topics/buy-side-risk-survey-2020) to read the rest of the series.

In January, when stock markets were nearing their peak, risk managers at Nordea Asset Management were imagining a disaster.

At the start of the year, the firm began running stress tests to see how its portfolios would weather the market impact of a pandemic. The results were used to rank funds by how exposed they were to liquidity strains and redemptions. By the time markets began to react to the spread of the coronavirus in March, they already had a game plan in place.

“We started seeking liquidity options earlier in the day, rather than at the time when the redemptions actually come in, and securing the liquidity needed to meet those redemptions,” says Thomas Vinding, head of trading at Nordea Asset Management.

Other firms took similar steps. And for the most part, fund managers weathered March’s storm.

Data from the European Fund and Asset Management Association shows that in March net outflows from Ucits funds totalled €313 billion ($358 billion), or nearly 3% of their net assets. But only up to €100 billion in Ucits and alternative investment fund assets – equivalent to just 0.64% of the regulated market – were subject to temporary suspension of redemptions and other liquidity management measures during the market stress, according to the European Securities and Markets Authority.

Fitch estimates only 0.11% of global fund assets were affected by such restrictions through May of this year.

Risk managers attribute this to preparations that were made well before March’s volatility. “Liquidity risk management is something that’s best done beforehand rather than in the teeth of the crisis, because by then, if you’re noticing these liquidity effects and they’re affecting you, it’s possibly too late. It’s either going to be difficult or expensive to do something about it,” says Christopher Reeve, director of risk at systematic hedge fund Aspect Capital.

The sudden [drop-off in liquidity](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7504371/swap-liquidity-slumps-as-treasury-stress-spreads) in March still seemed to catch some managers by surprise.

In Risk.net’s buy-side risk management [survey](https://www.risk.net/media/download/1047451), 61% of respondents say overall liquidity conditions met their expectations. However, experiences differed markedly across asset classes. Equity markets held up best, with 77% of respondents saying liquidity conditions met their expectations. In foreign exchange, 70% say liquidity was as expected and 62% say the same about rates markets.

Aspect deals in more liquid markets, but some of the currency and interest rate instruments it trades still “became a fair bit less liquid” in March, says Reeve. However, the firm was not forced to change its strategies or trade out of particular asset classes as a result.

It was a different story in credit and commodities, where a majority of respondents – 54% and 53% respectively – say liquidity was not what they expected.

Liquidity risk management took on greater importance as [trading conditions worsened](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7505206/us-treasury-market-holds-its-breath-after-high-drama). In the survey, only 4% of respondents ranked liquidity as their most important source of risk in normal times. In March, it became the most important source of risk for 35% of respondents. Another 39% ranked it second, behind investment risk.

Three months on, it remains at the top of the minds of investors. “It’s front and centre as a critical measure for our clients and potential clients and has far more prominence in client discussions,” says Ewan Mitchell, head of portfolio risk at Kames Capital, the UK arm of Aegon Asset Management. “During and after the peak Covid-19 volatility, the scale of liquidity questions we got from clients was unprecedented even relative to periods like Brexit.”

### Signs of trouble

Investors first noticed liquidity conditions deteriorating in early March, when the coronavirus began spreading more aggressively in Europe and the US.

“The illiquidity really started in the beginning of March, where we just weren’t getting execution on certain things that you would have expected. We recognised that straight away,” says William Goldthwait, a portfolio strategist at State Street Global Advisors.

As the reality of the pandemic dawned on markets, equity bid/offer spreads blew out to their widest levels since at least 2012. The median daily spread for stocks in the S&P 500 peaked at 23.4 basis points on March 23, five times the average in January and February, according to data from Goldman Sachs Investment Research.

It was a similar story in fixed income. US high-yield and investment-grade bonds saw spreads widen to 4.9 and 11.6 times their daily averages in January and February, according to data from MarketAxess.

“During some of the more challenging periods in March, it would cost about 10 times as much to execute a trade,” says Goldthwait.

Nordea’s Vinding points to shrinking dealer balance sheets as a leading cause of illiquidity in fixed income markets. “The traditional sell-side market-makers do not have the risk capacity they once had,” he says. “The dealers were not to the same extent taking a principal risk role – more an agency role.”

This meant the traditional request-for-quote model of trading in fixed income markets [broke down](https://www.risk.net/investing/markets/7536811/electronic-bond-trading-stalled-in-volatile-markets). “The tradeable quotes given by dealers were not the quotes on the screen,” says Vinding.

As a result, Nordea Asset Management focused more on indications of buying and selling interest – known as axes – to find opportunities to trade. They also turned to all-to-all trading platforms, where liquidity is available from counterparties on the buy side as well as the sell side.

Vinding says fund managers should assume similar illiquid conditions in fixed income, and even less dealer balance sheet availability, during future stress events.

Others used derivatives to maintain benchmark exposures when liquidity in bond markets became strained. “One of the interesting things that you’ll always see in periods of crisis is that the indexes or derivatives tend to be very liquid,” says Sudi Mariappa, head of portfolio risk management at Pimco. “This time around, for example, bond futures and current on-the-run Treasury bonds were really the only thing that traded for about three or four days. If you wanted to adjust duration, the futures were actually the most liquid way to shift your exposure.”

It was a similar story in the credit markets. While corporate bonds saw major dislocations, liquidity in credit default swaps (CDS) held up much better. “Even during the most volatile periods, you could trade within a basis point or two in fairly large sizes – $1 billion, $2 billion over a period of a day – while cash corporates, even for $5 million or $25 million, you had very, very wide bid/offers,” says Mariappa.

### Stressful times

From September 30, the type of stress tests Nordea was running will be mandatory for European funds.

Guidelines [published last year](https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma34-39-882_final_report_guidelines_on_lst_in_ucits_and_aifs.pdf) by Esma will require fund managers to run their portfolios through a variety of redemption shocks. These include historical events, such as the 2008 financial crisis, and hypothetical scenarios – widening credit spreads or a global pandemic, for example.

Asset managers will have to factor the [behaviour of investors](https://www.risk.net/investing/risk-management/7503006/funds-try-to-predict-behaviour-of-mystery-investors) into these liquidity stress tests – a tall task, given the difficulty of obtaining the necessary data from fund distributors and intermediaries.

The regulator also recommends reverse stress-testing, where firms identify the scenarios and circumstances that could lead to a defined outcome – such as a failure to meet a set level of redemptions.

According to the survey, 75% of asset managers already run some form of liquidity stress test. In most cases – 74% and 60%, respectively – these tests measure the time and cost to exit positions.

Kames runs liquidity reports on a monthly basis and increases the frequency during periods of market stress. The firm assumes that at most it will be able to trade 15% of a stock’s average daily volume (ADV) without prohibitively impacting the price in normal market conditions. Mitchell says this is a reasonably conservative assumption – he sees peers using ranges of between 15% and 30%, with an average of 25%. In stressed conditions, Kames uses a 5% ADV assumption.

The stress tests are used to assess the impact a liquidity crunch could have on a portfolio and factor into internal discussions about positioning. Since Kames follows a house investment view, the decision to trade out of a position can impact a number of funds. Mitchell says responsibility for understanding the liquidity implications of holdings and trading them accordingly ultimately rests with the firm’s portfolio managers.

Fund managers are also trying to understand the behaviour of their investors and avoid concentrations of similar minded end-clients.

“Liquidity risk is two-sided. It’s not just about the asset side of your balance sheet. It’s also about the liability side. We like to have where possible a non-concentrated diverse client base – a mix of clients with different return objectives and time horizons,” says Eoin Murray, head of investment at Federated Hermes.

This helps ensure that not all investors look to pull out their money at the same time. Retail investors will trade more in response to short-term market moves and will do so with small volumes. Institutional investors are less prone to knee-jerk reactions, but when they do redeem, the impact on funds can be significant.

At Kames, the risk team tracks the past behaviour of clients, where possible, to model the possible redemption scenarios under various market conditions.

Aspect also forecasts redemptions but did not see the volume of requests it feared. “At one point, we thought we might see a lot of redemption requests because in 2008 liquid strategies like ours were used by investors as a way of raising cash if they needed it for issues elsewhere in their portfolio or needed to de-risk somewhere and did it with the liquid part of their portfolio,” says Reeve.

“There was one relatively sizeable redemption that came through right in the teeth of the market volatile period in March, and we were able to fulfil that no problem,” he adds.

The survey results suggest liquidity risk management remains a work in progress at many firms. Two-thirds of respondents say they plan to make changes to their risk management practices as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. A significant number of these adjustments relate to liquidity risk management: 44% intend to conduct more severe liquidity stress tests, and 22% will run these more frequently; 24% plan to adjust their concentration limits. Others say they will review their funding sources (12%) and reduce stressed exposure to margin calls (15%).

At most firms, the changes will be incremental rather than seismic. “There’s no great sea change going on here as far as risk management, but there’s constant updating and adjusting that goes on, as I would assume happens in most places,” says SSGA’s Goldthwait.
