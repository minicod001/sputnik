The European Commission has backed plans to exempt buy-side entities from having to post variation margin on certain foreign exchange forwards. But with the regime’s January 3 start date bearing down – and a small window for regulatory change – industry sources believe European and national regulators will shortly announce forbearance for non-complying firms.

Currently, Europe is unique among major derivatives jurisdictions in requiring all financial users of physically settled forex forwards to post variation margin against their positions from the start of next year. The rule is controversial because forwards are a popular product among smaller market participants, many of which have [no experience](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2480707/buy-side-firms-seek-urgent-vm-relief) of daily margining.

The Council of the EU [last week](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5359331/eu-proposals-feed-hopes-of-fx-forward-vm-relief) proposed scrapping the requirement for buy-side entities – applying the rule to interbank trades only – in its version of changes to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir). To kill off the rule, however, the council’s proposal would have to survive three-way negotiations with the EC and European Parliament – talks that will not conclude this year.

An EC official says the body backs the council’s plan to exempt buy-side firms from the regime.

“The commission supports the efforts being made in the council working group and the attention this issue is receiving in the European Parliament. The need for international convergence in this area is undisputed,” said the official in an emailed statement to Risk.net.

The question is how and whether relief can be provided prior to any formal rule-change.

A temporary safe harbour could be created if Europe’s technical rule-writing bodies – the European Supervisory Authorities – can push back the deadline a second time. Margining was [originally slated](https://www.risk.net/regulation/2479367/giancarlo-march-vm-deadline-massive-challenge) to begin from March 1 this year, but physically settled forex forwards were given a reprieve because of problems [defining them](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/currency-derivatives/3848476/forex-swap-margin-treatment-uncertain-ahead-of-vm-deadline) in different EU member states.

The European Banking Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority – two of the three ESAs – [told Risk.net on November 20](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5360171/eba-and-eiopa-confirm-changes-to-vm-rule-for-forwards) that they are amending the RTS that postponed the start date. The third ESA is the European Securities and Markets Authority.

An amendment to the RTS would need to be approved by the EC before it could come into force, which may not be possible before January 3. Given the tight timeframe, the EC has asked for the amended text to be turned around quickly.

“The commission has urged Esma and the EBA to come forward with the necessary changes to the current technical standard, and understands that work is now advancing,” says the EC official.

Benoit Gourisse, senior director of European public policy at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, says changes to the RTS are unlikely to come into force until after January 3. Instead, relief will probably come in the form of a statement from the ESAs recommending national regulators do not enforce the margin requirement when it takes effect next year.

“We’re expecting a statement from the ESAs shortly that recommends flexibility on enforcement of the requirement to exchange variation margin on physically settled forex forwards once it comes into effect from January. We’re also expecting changes to be made to the RTS to carve out certain entities from the requirement, although this is unlikely to be ready before January – hence the need for the flexibility on enforcement. Both these initiatives are extremely important,” says Gourisse.

“Absent this quick response from the ESAs, we fear many market participants – European and non-European – would have [stopped trading](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5313881/fx-forwards-users-drop-eu-banks-over-margin-rule) with European dealers or stopped hedging forex risk,” he adds.

Two sources say there was a meeting between the Council of the EU, the ESAs and industry groups on November 21 at which the co-ordination of forbearance announcements was discussed. A spokesperson for the council confirms a meeting on Emir took place, but would not provide further details.

The mooted ESA statement may be similar to one [made in February](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/3936751/regulators-relent-ahead-of-vm-big-bang) granting forbearance to firms that were not ready to comply with the non-cleared margin rules from March 1. The ESAs said firms with “significant exposures” were expected to be compliant by that date, but smaller firms did not have to comply in time as long as they were making a good faith effort to get the [necessary paperwork](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2478801/docs-shock-how-dealers-are-tackling-the-vm-deadline) in place.

Given that the outcome of the Emir review could be a scrapping of the requirement for buy-side firms to margin their physical forwards, it’s not clear whether firms would be expected to continue making efforts to comply.

The rising expectations that the forex forwards margin requirement may be killed off have already led the buy side to [shelve preparations](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5361686/buy-side-delays-forex-forward-vm-plans-amid-uncertainty) to start margining their trades ahead of January 3. If the move is confirmed, some market participants expect the majority of forwards users will revert to trading uncollateralised, even if they have already signed collateral agreements.

Update, November 24: After we published this story, the ESAs [released a statement](https://esas-joint-committee.europa.eu/Pages/News/Variation-margin-exchange-for-physically-settled-FX-forwards-under-EMIR-.aspx) recommending national regulators enforce the rules in a “proportionate manner”.
