> _As replacement rate concerns become more pressing, firms fear Libor lawsuits and regulatory wrath_

Lions and tigers and bears, oh my. A terrible trifecta of operational, legal and conduct risks could be lying in wait for unsuspecting banks on the Libor transition road. Financial institutions should prepare themselves for these half-hidden hazards, say op risk experts – or face brutal consequences.

Among the challenges of educating clients of varying size and sophistication, experts anticipate the potential for claims of mis-selling, of negligent advice – or of inadvertently providing unauthorised advice rather than guidance. Also, there is the risk of adapting transactions to replacement rates in ways that could disadvantage or become unsuitable for clients. In its look at the operational pitfalls of Libor transition, more than a dozen bankers, lawyers, advisers and buy-side firms who spoke to Risk.net anticipated such risks arising.

And the clock is running down on the opportunity to pre-empt them.

“The largest banks are likely going to have to make business decisions about which customers to prioritise, and there are going to be some that don’t get the same level of information,” says Chris Bender, a director at advisory firm Chatham Financial. “There’s litigation risk – if the Libor transition results in a value transfer to a bank and a borrower isn’t provided with what it considers to be enough information, there’s a chance they’ll sue that bank.”

He says some attorneys who anticipate such scenarios have already begun work on lawsuits.

To arm themselves against these possibilities, financial firms must narrow the awareness gap between frequent and non-frequent issuers and clearly communicate to clients any increased complexity in the products they provide – such as a plain vanilla loan that becomes an exotic by the introduction of a floor.

Some say a significant element of this arsenal could lie in persuading borrowers to adhere to the forthcoming [fallback protocol](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7467936/sign-up-to-fallback-protocol-or-face-serious-questions-fca-warns) from the International Swaps and Derivatives Association – a cross-market multilateral sign-up mechanism which covers over-the-counter products.

Sharon Freeman, formerly Libor transition programme manager at Standard Chartered and now managing director of regulatory consultancy Antevorta, says banks should try to form specialist teams for Libor outreach efforts, arguing that training thousands of front-office staff in recherché Libor topics – many of which are specific to particular transactions or relationships – will be a significant challenge.

She also emphasises that banks shouldn’t simply push counterparties into signing up for the protocol – if they do so without a clear explanation of what the protocol language means for their clients’ transactions, they could run into conduct risk there too.

“The protocol is not a panacea [for legacy trades],” she says. “If you have lawyers advising, ‘Get the protocol signed’, and you haven’t done the analysis to explain all the impacts to that client and neither have they, you could be heading towards litigation.”

In many cases, clients are well aware of how much work remains for firms to undertake, says one financial adviser. They fear unfair treatment if banks focus all their attention on high-volume clients and fail to provide smaller counterparties with sufficiently detailed information, which could have dire consequences for the banks themselves.

A senior op risk professional, who oversees the compliance aspects of a bank’s transition programme, confirms the potential for transition-linked litigation is worrying lenders across the market.

“If a client feels they’ve had a bad outcome, a legal case is one of the remedies they would seek. So that risk is certainly something firms are very conscious of – and it’s a real concern for lots of organisations,” says the source, “But it’s a driver of focus that is being made – and needs to be made – on client communication.”

In fact, banks are sufficiently worried by the potential for significant transition-related op risk exposure to have sounded out regulators on the prospect of capital relief from losses. In its most recent [Q&A on the prudential regulatory framework](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d503.pdf), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has made clear to supervisors that Libor op risk losses should not be exempt from capital calculations.

Basel warns that losses may be incurred over an extended period of time, should banks fail to identify and remediate legacy contracts prior to discontinuation of a rate, and states: “Operational risk losses relating to the reform of benchmark reference rates do not fulfil the criteria for exclusion from the calculation of operational risk capital requirements laid out in [Basel III] (ie, characterised as one-off, no longer relevant, no residual exposure).”

It also notes, however, that run-of-the-mill transition cost should not be treated as op risk losses, which would accrue capital, such as legal fees to alter contracts or costs related to adjustments to IT systems.

### Fearful asymmetry

Some observers think the central issue for banks is information asymmetry between clients. Required by regulation to educate clients on what the Libor transition could mean for their transactions, a bank must explain to a borrower how the replacement of a rate could affect that borrower’s finances. So, given their relative lack of sophistication, it might seem logical for a bank to coach its smaller clients as a matter of priority.

But this is not what’s happening in practice, say insiders.

“These large banks are going to prioritise their biggest and most important clients,” says Chatham’s Bender. “They do the most work with them, they make the most money from them, and they’re going to dedicate their resources to making sure [they] are happy.”

This could prove to be a false economy if small firms with [greater need of information resources](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7541721/big-banks-worry-small-lenders-could-derail-libor-switch) find they have not been adequately supported. While transactions with these clients may be smaller in total notional terms, there are more of them in sheer number. Which creates the potential for many lawsuits if clients feel they have been disadvantaged.

Besides such legal risk, banks will also attract the attention of supervisors if they are delinquent in keeping smaller customers up to speed. The Financial Conduct Authority, which supervises Libor transition, says all banks must [treat customers fairly](https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/libor/conduct-risk-during-libor-transition). They have the same duty of care to all clients – large and small – to ensure they understand the risks associated with the end of Libor and that the transition is not used as a rationale for introducing “inferior terms”.

“The underlying need across all [customers] is that communications are fair, clear and not misleading. The evidence reaching us is that everyone is at great pains to ensure customers are treated fairly and feel that they are treated fairly,” says FCA’s director of markets and wholesale policy Edwin Schooling Latter.

UBS is one firm currently wrestling with this dilemma, according to Libor migration lead Angus Graham. He says the work involved in managing the transactions of larger clients is often straightforward – they are, he explains, professional and easy to pin down.

“The challenge we’ve got is the long tail problem,” says Graham. “If you look at the profile of every firm, you’re going to have a few very large counterparties with many transactions and very active relationships. Those, clearly, we’ll be able to handle.” But, Graham adds: “You get into a tail of small clients, going right out into the distance, some of which won’t be active anymore. We have to treat every client equally, so we’ve got to manage that entire tail.”

### Dangerous territory

Complicating this duty of care is the fact that banks are prohibited by regulation from providing financial advice to clients. This could prove a problem – some banks say the line between “educating” clients on Libor transition and “advising” them has not been made totally clear, and that supervisors have not given enough clarity on the point.

“The concern is fairly widespread,” says Andrew Eddy, a design architect for Libor transition at UBS. “The issue is the fact that, depending on what information the client requires, there is still uncertainty about what the solution is. Their natural question is, ‘So, what are my options?’ The moment the conversation goes down that route, it becomes potential advice.”

The FCA says any firm can provide ‘guidance’, which the supervisor characterises as general information about financial products, among other things; but activity constituting ‘advice’ to clients – which the FCA says can include recommendations and opinions – must be authorised separately. Banks’ fear of treading too close to the advice line, Eddy continues, is another threat to outreach efforts.

“It is actually slowing down communication. There’s a lot of information out there, and there are challenges in communicating that – particularly to less sophisticated audiences who want to jump from the ‘Help me understand’ to the ‘Tell me what my options are’ conversations a lot quicker,” says Eddy. “That creates reticence. Even when you’re trying to do the right thing, you can be penalised for having done it in a way that, subsequently, proves to be incorrect.”

According to the FCA’s live [webpage](https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/libor/conduct-risk-during-libor-transition) on Libor transition conduct risk, firms should avoid worrying too much about breaking the no advice rule. Indeed, the FCA says it will “challenge” firms on the basis of fair customer treatment if they display “unfounded fear” about “presenting” or “discussing” alternative products with clients. Firms, the FCA says, should be capable of providing an “objective overview of the benefits, costs and risks of a range of alternatives to a client’s existing Libor-linked exposure, without inferring a recommendation”.

Schooling Latter also says banks should stick to facts, remaining balanced and objective. That’s the best way to avoid straying over the line, he says, and argues that, in a situation where the switchover will result in fiscal harm to a given client, it’s fine for a bank to inform the client of that fact. It will not constitute advice, he says, so long as the bank’s warning comes as part of a description of a realistic range of potential consequences.

“If a particular move in interest rates would have a particular mathematical impact on the customer’s position, and you’re being balanced in your description of the range of possible moves in interest rates, then I think it remains possible to give information to your clients that is factual rather than crossing the advice boundary,” he says.

### In the long grass

While sources agree that providing tailored information to large, sophisticated customers is probably easier than giving smaller firms a crash course, the education for each must be specific to the trades between them.

For large clients, the challenge is in the volume of Libor-pegged material, all of which has to be addressed in sufficient detail; for small clients, it’s in ensuring that the information delivered is at once coherent, timely and actionable.

Banks are doing their best to navigate this “sophistication spectrum” in a vigorous fashion, says Deepak Sitlani, a derivatives specialist at Linklaters. Some – such as UBS – have been using approaches including the “information bomb” technique, where emails and letters containing fundamental information are sent out to clients en masse. The objective of this approach is to ensure each client has a reliable package of data they can consult when necessary.

But it’s no substitute for a bespoke approach, argues Sitlani. The way information is expressed is key, he argues – and the language has to be suitable for the customer in question.

“If you give a sophisticated client information that is too basic, you’re teaching grandma to suck eggs. And if you give an unsophisticated client information that is too complex, it may be too hard to understand,” he says. “The aim is for banks to give out information which is in substance largely the same to the breadth of its client base, but also tailor it to deal with differing levels of sophistication.”

Linklaters is currently working with “a few” banks on that specific task, he adds.

The issue is compounded because some of the less sophisticated firms banks deal with may not fully understand the financial instruments they sign off on, says Sitlani, adding that [the issue is reasonably widespread](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7547611/structured-products-are-lost-in-translation-post-libor).

“There is a large subset of clients out there that enter into derivatives … where the lender requires them to enter an interest rate cap, for example. But they have little experience in derivatives – they’re doing it because they’re told they have to,” he adds.

Currently, interest rate caps are considered vanilla products. However, the methodology underlying them could become more complicated after Libor transition, as firms will need to begin averaging the daily rates over the given period if no term structure develops.

### Differing dynamics

Differing rate dynamics between interbank and overnight rates add a further layer of complexity, even for vanilla products such as loans. François Jarrosson, director in hedging and derivatives at Rothschild & Co, uses the difference between Libor-linked and Sonia-linked loans as an example. When a client borrows from a bank today, the bank will expect the client to pay a coupon of Libor + x; if that Libor turns negative, its value is deemed to be zero.

The bank would likely seek to add a zero-rate floor to a Sonia loan, he adds – because Libor is inherently [a direct gauge](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7426316/fca-dismisses-libor-credit-component-concerns) of interbank creditworthiness, it invariably fixes higher than Sonia – meaning a loan made at Sonia is much more likely to hit the floor.

Banks know this well – lenders have been fretting for some time about the lack of a [credit-sensitive](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7561711/credit-problem-sofr-faces-uphill-struggle-in-loan-market) component in most overnight rates – but many clients don’t, says Jarrosson. This puts the onus on lenders to explain the inherent transfer of value entailed in switching loans to new rates, and potential accusations of [mis-selling](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7533606/emergency-covid-loans-carry-high-mis-selling-risk-banks-fear) if they don’t.

“[On Sonia], a 0% floor is struck much more quickly,” Jarrosson says. “That means there is a transfer of value for the client, and they should be made aware. It’s probably going to be a tricky issue for everyone. The 0% floor on Libor and the 0% floor on Sonia result in different economics.”

Jarrosson says less sophisticated issuers vastly outnumber advanced firms, and that those knowledgeable clients are largely the top half of the FTSE 100. Everybody else, he says – the bottom half and below – are less frequent issuers and are unlikely to be aware of the floor issue.

### Herding cats?

Some banks see the solution for swaps products in the yet-to-be-published Isda fallback protocol; legislative fixes are also being mooted for so-called [tough legacy](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7556951/twin-track-solution-for-tough-legacy-libor-falls-flat) contracts. If every client would sign up to the protocol and adhere, they say, a lot of those issues would simply recede.

“There’s focus on the Isda protocol because it will address 95% of our exposures, essentially, in one fell swoop” says UBS’s Graham. The bank will aim to ensure that adoption is as widespread as possible among clients, he continues; if counterparties don’t sign up in sufficient numbers, new problems could arise. If only half of the Libor market accepts the protocol, Graham explains, UBS’s risk becomes a lot more difficult to handle – the bank’s netting sets are divided, and basis risks increase.

“Our challenge, once the wording is agreed, is to maximise market adoption,” Graham adds. “You see the regulators encouraging people. It’s in the market’s interest for as many people as possible to adopt and accept it.”

Robert Pickel, ex-Isda chief executive and now chair of the [Prime Finance](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2325797/prime-finance-goldens-quest-completion) initiative, argues that acceptance of the protocol is the market’s best option. He cites the success of other Isda protocols over the years, noting that even protocols that don’t attract 100% adherence are still an effective mechanism – and quips that they provide a type of “herd immunity” for markets.

Pickel points out, however, that the scale of the Libor transition is greater than any market shift Isda has previously managed. Protocols have largely applied to CDS markets, which, he adds are “dwarfed” by the scale of interest rate markets. And while 80% or 90% adherence would constitute a strong showing for most protocols, Libor-linked markets are sizeable enough that an outstanding 10% or 20% would constitute a great many firms.

Authorities have welcomed consensus mechanisms such as the Isda protocols. The FCA’s Schooling Latter argues that if firms use this mechanism – and most are trying to do so – they are likely to be considered compliant.

But while a reassuring regulatory voice may assuage some fears, there is still a large amount of anxiety in the market.
