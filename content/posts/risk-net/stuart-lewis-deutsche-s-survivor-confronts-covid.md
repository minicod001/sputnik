{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_CRO talks loan reserves, VAR breaches, and the lessons of a lurid past_{{< /quote >}}

Josef Ackermann, Anshu Jain, Juergen Fitschen, John Cryan, Christian Sewing – there have been five chief executives of Deutsche Bank during the bleak, bruising years since 2012, but only one chief risk officer (CRO). How has Stuart Lewis done it?

Some CROs would try to avoid answering that. Lewis – a straightforward, softly spoken Scot – takes it on.

“We do a good job of understanding financial risk. You saw that in 2008 and afterwards,” he says. “I think our biggest failing was on the non-financial side.”

He’s alluding to the more than $20 billion of fines and settlements Deutsche has accumulated since the global financial crisis. Most recently, on July 7, the bank paid $150 million to New York state supervisors for compliance failings arising in part from its business with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Other – far larger – penalties arose from Libor rigging, US sanction-busting and the mis-selling of mortgage securities.

Seen this way, Deutsche has essentially been suffering a long, unpleasant hangover resulting from the amoral behaviour of the past – behaviour that originated in the business lines and should have been policed there, says Lewis.

“You need to manage these non-financial risks proactively. You need preventative controls in the first line with supervisors properly supervising their charges, and every day educating people on what is the right thing to do, and what is not acceptable. Historically, that’s been our biggest failing – but I would say our culture is changing quite dramatically. It started to change with John, and it continues to change with Christian.”

Wasn’t Lewis part of this culture, though? His career at Deutsche Bank dates back almost 25 years, and he was elevated to CRO of its infamously aggressive investment banking division in 2010.

Lewis says he had misgivings about the way the business was run – and shared them.

“The point I tried to make is that if you just purely focus on bringing the revenues in, and you’re kind of agnostic to the job your traders are doing beyond that, then you’re not really owning your business front to back. You’re just abrogating the responsibility to someone else,” he says.

History will record that voices such as Lewis did not win the behind-the-scenes fight for Deutsche Bank’s soul – at the time, at least. Since then, successive chief executives have confronted the legacy of those years, each one keeping faith with Lewis and his leadership of the risk function. Last year, the CRO’s role was expanded to include the bank’s global anti-financial crime efforts.

There is more work to do on that front, Lewis acknowledges, but, in 2020, long-dormant financial risk has made a comeback, bringing its own, less lurid controversies.

### Through the cycle

Credit has been “the big, big challenge”, Lewis says.

Every lender has had to make the very public call on how much to set aside to cover future loan losses. Always a carefully scrutinised number, the exercise was complicated in the first and second quarters by the march of the pandemic. It was an early test for the still-new International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9), which requires reserves to be built earlier, and prompted supervisors to wade in with guidance on how to apply those standards in the context of what was initially expected to be a short-lived economic shock.

In its first-quarter results, Deutsche announced €500 million ($572.1 million) in set-asides for bad loans, up nearly fourfold from the first quarter of 2019 – but not as steep a rise, relative to the size of its loan books, as some European peers. The bank further signalled a likely increase of €800 million in provisioning for the second quarter, which Lewis expects to be the high-water mark for provisioning, pointing to an annual tally of roughly €2 billion. That is barely a quarter of the eye-watering provisioning unveiled by US lenders such as Citi or [Wells Fargo](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7655086/loan-loss-provision-charges-nearly-triple-at-wells-fargo) during the second quarter alone.

Part of the reason for this divergence is a basic difference in loan portfolios, Lewis argues. Most US banks, and many Europeans, have larger consumer loan exposures, and tend to bake the assumption of higher losses on card debt into pricing up front. One graph (compiled by Deutsche) compares the bank with a set of unnamed peers, and implies it is not out of step – those with a smaller share of consumer lending in their business also have lower reserves, and vice versa.

But a thornier explanation for the reserving gulf lies in a change to the bank’s loan-loss modelling – one that arguably has as much to do with European economic policy as with prudence.

On March 20, the European Central Bank (ECB) said it [wouldn’t force](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7511896/eu-banks-eye-bad-loan-relief-from-state-guarantees) lenders to automatically shift loans deemed “unlikely to pay” into the non-performing category – the [third stage](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5303966/stage-fright-banks-tackle-ifrs-9-loan-loss-volatility) of impairment under IFRS 9, when reserves have to reflect expected losses over the entire lifetime of each loan – if those obligations were covered by state guarantees or debt moratoriums. In Germany alone, where much of Deutsche’s loan book resides, the government has offered €600 billion in guarantees, among other generous fiscal and monetary interventions.

Perversely, says Lewis, this puts the bank in a bind: the clear message to lenders from governments and regulators has been to look through the crisis and keep the supply of credit to the real economy flowing. The accounting standards call for something rather different.

“There is a challenge around how you respond to the ECB instructions to try and look through, a little bit, the downturn – which was initially expected to be not so prolonged – such that you don’t remove a lot of capital supply from the system. Any removed capital would not be available to help the demand that would come through on increased drawdowns or new borrowings,” says Lewis. “That’s been an interesting discussion across the audit community.”

Deutsche certainly saw increased demand for cash in March. As clients drew on their revolving credit facilities, there was a knock-on impact on the bank’s own funding needs, says Lewis, with about €18 billion of drawdown that month alone.

The bank uses a forward-looking indicator model to project losses across its loan portfolios, based on inputs from expected losses on stage 3 loans, as well as broader macroeconomic conditions. Where other banks have chosen to manually override models in response to the Covid-19 meltdown, nudging outputs down using management overlays, Deutsche has taken the more fundamental step of shifting the economic horizon on the model from two years to three – allowing more time for borrowers to recover, and resulting in dramatically lower loss assumptions.

Lewis offers two different, but linked, justifications. The first is that the historic relationship between economic stress and default rates will break down in this current crisis.

“I think we’re trying to be realistic. The big challenge that all these models have is that you’re using historical observed correlations, principally between GDP and unemployment – GDP falling, unemployment going up – and default probabilities. Right now, our view is that, given the consumer support measures and the moratorium that’s going on in Germany, for example, the forecast -9.4% Q2 GDP collapse for Germany won’t correlate to the same probability of default increase that we’ve seen historically,” he says.

The second is that higher assumed losses would produce a much sharper jump in reserves, making it harder for banks to keep lending through the crisis – and letting down everyone from borrowers to the ECB.

“All the information we have – and this model gets updated now on a weekly basis, depending on what the risk assessed is – if we just deployed the normal model today, we’d end up taking a significant amount out of our capital supply, only to release it again in the third and fourth quarter. That is in nobody’s interests and is completely contrary to what everyone’s expecting us to do at this point in time,” he says.

There’s an irony here, which is not lost on Lewis. Proponents of IFRS 9 believed it would be less procyclical: in building buffers prior to a wave of defaults, credit supply would be able to continue through an economic slump. Or, to put it more crudely, airbags would inflate prior to the point of impact, rather than afterwards. In the new system’s first real-world crash test, however, supervisors have had to intervene.

Lewis observes that “no-one really expected this kind of cliff-edge fall” when the new standards were being written.

“A lot of regulation tends to respond to the last crisis, and then envisages that the next crisis will somewhat follow it. And they probably envisaged a little bit more of a slow-burn situation [than Covid-19]. Economies generally don’t just collapse 10% in a quarter – in a recession, you tend to get declines of 1%, or 2% over a quarter, over an extended period of time. Then there is monetary and fiscal support, and things start to bounce back over a year or two,” he says.

What gives him comfort beyond trusting to modelling, however, is a renewed emphasis on the kind of fundamental credit analysis he cut his teeth on. In a bid to gauge division-wide risks, nearly 2,000 borrowers within the corporate and investment bank had been individually assessed by July, looking at how cashflows have been affected and business models disrupted. Airlines and the hospitality sector feature most prominently in the higher-risk lists, as well as commercial real estate, and oil and gas, among others.

Lewis and his credit risk teams have asked basic questions of those counterparties where they identify a risk of sustained damage: where does the bank stand with respect to collateral valuations? Has it offered any waivers on breaches of loan agreements? Is the firm’s cashflow likely to recover, even as the rest of the economy does?

“That kind of fundamental analysis is in our view more important than: ‘What are you modelling right now?’ We’ve got to do the modelling because the regulators and accountants are constantly demanding it. But, if we do that top-down modelling, can we reconcile it with what we think will actually happen? Now, it might well be that if we have a big second wave [of infections], we have to reappraise the portfolios and the sectors we have exposure to. [But] we can only do what we know today.”

### A 1,017% VAR breach

While Deutsche and others were scratching their heads about the long-term impact of an economic shutdown on their loan books, many investors were making similar calls about their own portfolios in a matter of minutes, hours or days. The result was a wildfire of uncertainty in stocks, bonds and other markets.

“Some of the volatility and the moves we saw in the first quarter were as big if not bigger than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2008 – quite dramatically so across equity and rates in particular,” says Lewis.

For dealers, this is a double-edged sword – bid/offer spreads widen, but any inventory can quickly generate significant mark-to-market losses. Lewis says the bank’s market risk team was “managing positions intensively” during the period, but was doing so from a position of relative comfort – during the first quarter, Deutsche had an average value-at-risk of €24 million. Existing large hedges also paid off when needed, he says, pointing to the leveraged debt capital markets book as an example, but declining to provide detail.

It was still a stressful experience, with volatility forcing regular decisions on whether existing risk limits were appropriate. Lewis estimates his team, in concert with trading desks, manually overrode roughly 1,000 value-at-risk limits during a period of three or four weeks in March. By June, the bank had already seen 28 VAR exceptions, including a [1,017% breach](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7545691/trading-losses-at-us-units-of-deutsche-rbc-exceed-var-by-1000) on one portfolio in its US unit – as many as it recorded during the whole of 2008, only this time with almost all of its employees working from home, along with those of its clients and counterparties.

Lewis declines to explain that mammoth US breach, but he says it’s not safe to assume busted limits in its US operation translate into losses for the bank.

“We have this problem with split hedges in the US,” he says. “When you’re looking at VAR breaches in Deutsche Bank Securities Inc [DBSI], what happens is one leg of the position is booked there, but portfolio hedges are actually booked in the London branch, so you don’t get the offset.”

### Deutsche counts ‘the cost of doing business’
* March 2017 – Deutsche settles with Kaupthing Bank for €450 million over claims related to its advice on two structure credit trades in the run-up to the Icelandic bank’s collapse in 2008.
* Jan 2017 – Deutsche pays more $7.4 billion to settle MBS mis-selling and misrepresentation claims with the US Department of Justice.
* April 2015 – US regulators fine Deutsche $2.1 billion, and UK watchdogs $340 million, over Libor rigging. The European Commission had already fined the bank €725 million ($830.1 billion) in 2013.
* February 2014 – bank pays heirs of media mogul Leo Kirch €925 million to settle claims that Deutsche’s then-chief executive Rolf Breuer (Stuart Lewis’s second boss) was responsible for their firm’s bankruptcy, after he publicly questioned its solvency. Deutsche confirms it will seek redress from Breuer.
* December 2010 – bank settles tax fraud claims with US authorities for $553 million.

He adds that the crisis is generally acting as a reminder that VAR is intended to provide guidance in normal conditions – Deutsche places more emphasis on limits derived from stress scenarios than on basic VAR limits.

“I think everyone recognises the limitations of VAR, and that’s why we don’t use VAR on a daily basis to manage our risk limits. Instead, we use a variety of stress limits,” he says.

Regulators continue to use VAR heavily, of course – the measure sits at the heart of outgoing market risk capital rules – but they also implicitly acknowledged its shortcomings following a blizzard of breaches that would ordinarily result in the widespread application of statutory capital multipliers. Risk.net [reported in June](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7557161/eu-urged-to-pass-permanent-market-risk-capital-relief) that European policy-makers were expected to allow this rule to be softened in another effort to ease the pressure on banks.

The March meltdown brought other challenges, such as a sharp rise in margin consumption – over the last two or three weeks of March, Lewis estimates the bank had to raise as much as €5 billion in additional funding to meet margin calls. It also sparked disputes with the hedge fund community on collateralised swaps.

There were opportunities, too: the bank’s fixed income unit raked in €1.9 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 12% from a year earlier. Even its troubled US unit profited from volatility: the division reported a 55% increase in trading revenues for the quarter, at $127 million.

### Tough legacy

Despite this historic flare-up in market and credit exposure, there’s no getting away from non-financial risk – not if you are Deutsche Bank, anyway.

As one example of its hard-to-shake legacy, the bank remains under heightened scrutiny from the Bank of England following censure for failing to improve money laundering controls that have generated hundreds of millions of euros in fines. Lewis says great efforts have been made to meet expectations, including the appointment of Stephan Wilken as the new [head of anti-financial crime](https://www.db.com/newsroom_news/2018/stephan-wilken-appointed-head-of-anti-financial-crime-en-11676.htm) in September 2018. Lewis, along with Wilken, has [reportedly](https://www.ft.com/content/97ffaffe-5983-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc) been compelled to meet more often with the UK regulator as part of efforts to assuage concerns.

Automation has helped the bank up its game. It is now able to check 28 million names per day as part of its know-your-customer (KYC) processes, says Lewis – up from 700,000 names per week a few years ago.

The bank has been getting feedback from supervisors that it is “on the right track”, Lewis says, but he also warns this is a long track – more marathon than sprint.

“This is our fourth year into the process of reforming our anti-financial crime function and if we look at other peer banks that have undertaken similar reforms, it usually takes seven or eight years to complete this work. Our book of work reflects this: there is still a fair amount of work to get done,” he says.

Another example is the Epstein episode. That may have spurred fresh headlines about Deutsche’s attitude to whom it banks for, but far more coverage – as well as a book and a subpoena – has been generated by its ties to US president Donald Trump, whose long bid to keep his tax returns out of the public domain appears finally to have failed. The US Supreme Court on July 9 ruled congressional subpoenas for Trump’s tax returns to Deutsche Bank were constitutional. Deutsche has said it will not challenge the decision – although Trump’s attorneys have reportedly not given up the fight.

While Lewis declines to comment on any individual clients, he says changes have been made to the bank’s KYC checks – including a sharper focus on understanding and monitoring a client’s reputation.

Deutsche Bank terminated its relationship with Epstein in 2018, “following additional negative press related to Mr Epstein’s past criminal conduct”, according to the consent order published by the New York State Department of Financial Services.

“So, we have in the wealth management space today a variety of ways of understanding either a client’s, or potential client’s, media profile – and that will inform us during our annual KYC review, whether that customer is still someone we want to have with us at the firm," he says.

Deutsche Bank has a reputational risk framework in place, overseen by a group reputational risk committee co-chaired by Lewis. The bank also has regional risk and business division reputational risk committees.

“I think the challenge there is to try and make sure these business units are all on the same page in terms of understanding what types of issues can cause reputational harm to the firm. My own observation in this space is that there are two types of control environment you can operate with. One is detective controls, where you work after the event to see if there is anything we should be concerned about and therefore manage. The other type is preventative controls. And reputational risk absolutely lends itself to preventative risk management, so ‘don’t do anything stupid in the first place’."

Lewis adds: “When we look at lessons learned in this space, with a high degree of frequency where we have had a problem, it’s because proper protocol has not been adhered to."

Whatever the post-Covid landscape holds, Lewis has already enjoyed one of the longest tenures of any CRO at a major global bank: he’s been in the job longer than the CROs of Citi, JP Morgan, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Barclays and UBS, among others. Industry forums put the average length of tenure of a CRO at a large US bank at three-and-a-half years. Lewis has managed double that – and he is, he says, “not planning on going anywhere”.
