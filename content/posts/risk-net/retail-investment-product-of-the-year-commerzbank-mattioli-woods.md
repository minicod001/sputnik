{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Risk Awards 2018: Multi-line fund freshens up UK structured products_{{< /quote >}}

Structured products providers face a tough retail market in the UK. The Financial Conduct Authority, if not actively hostile, cautioned retail investors against choosing complex products in its most recent market review in 2015. Some investors are wary after the high-profile liquidation of Jubilee Financial Products in the same year.

An additional problem is a lack of diversification – plans can offer just one or two streams of equity-linked payouts, which could fail to materialise at the end of the year. Then there is the investor’s credit risk to the bank that has created the product in the first place.

Commerzbank and £7.5 billion ($10 billion) asset manager Mattioli Woods have struck upon the idea of putting structured products in a Ucits fund, which they hope will address these problems and promises to change the way structured products are offered.

The Ucits structure is more appealing to UK investors, as it means they do not have to deal with the operational complexities of a structured products plan and will benefit from the transparency of Ucits funds and their typically daily liquidity. Diversification and counterparty credit problems will subside. More than a dozen structured payouts can be actively managed by the structured products firm. If the fund uses swaps to manage these payouts, counterparty credit risk to a bank is reduced.

Mattioli Woods is the first to devise a multi-line structured products fund in a Ucits format. Atlantic House Fund Management, Hilbert Investment Solutions and Societe Generale have since released similar multi-line products. Credit Suisse is thought to be working to launch a similar product soon.

The Commerzbank/MW Structured Products Fund launched in November 2016 and offers daily liquidity with an annual management fee of 75 basis points.

The fund has had a high uptake among traditional Mattioli Woods clients and the firm is seeking to distribute it further. At the end of September, it had £133 million in assets under management, having initially aimed to raise £50 million.

The head of structured products at a large UK asset manager thinks it has been put together in a smart way. “You can tailor the structures to benefit from rocky markets, markets stagnating and going down a bit,” he says.

The fund has 17 streams of structured products payouts at the time of writing. Six of these are range accrual products, each tied to two equity indexes. These pay out if both indexes stay in a given daily range.

Five products are defensive autocalls, each tied to two equity indexes. These pay out if both indexes are above a given quarterly floor.

Three are supertracker autocalls tracking European banks, European equities and an index of UK and US equities. If the index exceeds a given floor after six years, the product pays out a multiple of the excess. Other products in the fund are a basic resources index autocall, a bonus coupon autocall and a bearish autocall.

### Active management

The benefit comes from the ability of Mattioli Woods to actively manage the products, avoiding risks it can see and taking the administrative burden from the retail investor, who may have little talent managing structured products.

“While a client can buy and hold a structured products plan, and wait and hope for the best, we are positioning ourselves as advisers in the structured products field,” says Mark Fuller, head of structured products at Mattioli Woods.

“We can anticipate certain events. For example, if a structured product is due to pay a coupon, and we think there’s a danger that the coupon doesn’t get paid, we can cash it early,” he says. “We can look at six or seven potential structured product payoffs at once and decide which is best, rather than giving the client the one option.”

Fuller says Mattioli Woods was well positioned to offer a multi-line fund before others as its model of managing structured products was very similar.

“Some financial advisers advise to put all your money in structured products. Our approach has never been that. Our approach has been to invest little and often in structured products, and that’s led to clients holding a portfolio of structured products, which is administratively burdensome,” he says. It was a small logical jump to take the administration away from retail investors in a fund-like product.

The second benefit of the fund is a reduction in counterparty risk. It attains its positions via swaps collateralised with gilts, rather than via bonds or structured notes issued by banks with the added credit risk that comes with it.

“The way [other] structured products are priced involves zero-coupon bonds, which are linked to the counterparty risk of a bank, plus structured product performance. So you aren’t getting rewarded for the performance of a pure structured products fund,” says Ben Wattam, co-manager of the Mattioli Woods fund.

A Ucits fund format has the additional advantage of an open-ended fund, its liquidity and transparency not offered in a traditional structured products plan.

“It’s a buy-and-hold asset like most structured products but if the client wanted money back, we would just unwind some of the underlying assets,” says Wattam.

The fund’s total expense ratio, which gives a comprehensive picture of the annual costs, is 97 basis points.
