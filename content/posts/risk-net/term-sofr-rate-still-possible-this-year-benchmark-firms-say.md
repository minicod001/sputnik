Benchmark providers say forward-looking term rates linked to the replacement for US dollar Libor could be available as soon as the end of this year, at least in trial form. Transition officials had previously warned that insufficient liquidity in the underlying swaps market could thwart plans to produce a term benchmark by mid-2021.

Stelios Tselikas, chief operating officer at Ice Benchmark Administration (IBA), says the firm has made good progress toward building a term version of the secured overnight financing rate, or SOFR. “We’re monitoring liquidity, we’ve developed the models and we’ve engaged with data providers,” he says. “I think there is a chance for that to be up and running this year.”

FTSE Russell confirms it is looking at a similar timeframe for its term SOFR rate.

CME Group, which has been publishing indicative [term SOFR strip rates](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/sofr-strip-rates.html) since June 2019, plans to launch a beta term SOFR using its full calculation methodology later this year.

The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), which is overseeing the US Libor transition, will run a [request-for-proposal process](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7567246/sonia-term-rate-nears-beta-release-while-sofr-struggles) in September to select an official term SOFR rate provider. Publication is expected to begin in the first half of 2021.

Agha Mirza, global head of interest rate products at CME, confirms the exchange group will be throwing its hat in the ring: “We’re working towards building the benchmark administration and intend to participate in ARRC’s RFP.”

While compounded-in-arrears versions of SOFR will be used in most products, the ARRC recommends forward-looking term rates as the primary fallback for some instruments. These include floating rate bonds, bilateral business loans, syndicated loans and securitisations, where issuers require visibility over payment amounts.

But senior figures at the ARRC have sought to temper expectations around a term SOFR rate, stressing that more liquidity is needed in the underlying swaps market to construct robust benchmarks.

“We are very, very reliant on people in the market taking the actions they need to move markets and provide the ARRC with enough transactions that we could potentially endorse a term SOFR,” Tom Wipf, chair of the ARRC and vice-president of institutional securities at Morgan Stanley, said at an event on July 13.

SOFR swaps traded just $253 billion notional in the first half of 2020, according to data from the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. That amounts to less than 1% of the $63 trillion traded in dollar Libor swaps over the same period. “I think at this point we would have anticipated significantly more activity in the derivatives market to actually create the transactions that would begin to develop that curve,” Wipf said.

### Back to the futures

CME is starting with the futures market, where transaction volumes far exceed those in swaps. SOFR futures listed at CME traded an average of $143.7 billion notional-equivalent each day in the first half of 2020. The exchange is currently using settlement prices from these transactions to calculate indicative forward-looking term SOFR rates in one-, three- and six-month tenors.

“At the shorter end of the curve there is much more development of SOFR futures than SOFR-based OIS swaps,” says Mirza. “When you’re implying rates out of derivatives, whether it’s listed futures or cleared OTC swaps, they are market-transacted rates containing a lot of significant information.”

CME’s methodology is consistent with an approach set out in a 2019 Federal Reserve [working paper](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019014pap.pdf) on inferring term rates from SOFR futures prices and can be adapted to include other inputs such as swap quotes, should liquidity ramp up. This could happen in October, when LCH and CME begin [using SOFR to discount future cashflows](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6868566/lch-plans-october-2020-sofr-discounting-switch) on cleared US dollar transactions.

An earlier [March 2018 paper](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Microsites/arrc/files/2018/ARRC-Second-report) from the ARRC laid out three methodologies for building term SOFR rates using data from futures and overnight index swap (OIS) transactions or firm quotes from central limit order books (Clobs). CME ultimately hopes to capture elements of all three.

“Our methodology is flexible and our approach is to take implied rates out of both swaps and futures, but currently in the US, CME futures data is very significant,” says Mirza.

CME will need to include data on transactions and executable quotes in its calculation to ensure its rate remains compliant with international standards, including principles set out by the International Organization of Securities Commissions.

“Our indicative rate is based on rigorous calculations and from very reliable settlement data,” says Mirza. “As we move to the next stage and work towards being a benchmark administrator for term SOFR, we will expand our data sampling source to include transactions as well as executable quotes.”

IBA, which administers Libor rates in five major currencies, is taking a slightly different approach. It is currently building a term risk-free rate (RFR) for the UK market, where regulators have identified OIS quotes from Clobs as the preferred inputs for term versions of the sterling overnight index average (Sonia). In part, this reflects the liquidity profile of Sonia derivatives.

Sonia swaps traded $8 trillion notional equivalent in the first quarter of 2020, Isda data show, while Sonia futures listed across three exchanges traded just £1.7 trillion ($2.17 trillion) over the same period. This balance may be shifting. Sonia swaps volume fell to $2.2 trillion for the second quarter, while futures trading soared to £3.2 trillion.

IBA uses committed swap quotes for its term Sonia rate, with Ice-listed Sonia futures – the most liquid among three exchange providers – as a secondary input. SOFR futures listed at Ice would be included in IBA’s term SOFR methodology, though it’s not yet clear whether these would sit above or below swaps in the waterfall of inputs. Ice-listed SOFR futures are less liquid than their CME counterparts, trading average daily volume of $25 billion across one- and three-month contracts over the first half of this year.

FTSE Russell, part of the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), IHS Markit and Refinitiv are also developing [term RFRs for sterling](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7532026/sonia-term-rate-contenders-tested-by-market-mayhem) and euro markets and will be in the running to provide an official term SOFR rate. However, they could find it harder to adapt their methodologies for the US market.

CME is not involved in term RFR efforts in Europe. But the exchange group is a registered benchmark administrator under the European Union’s Benchmarks Regulation – ensuring its SOFR rate can be used in contracts globally. The status was inherited from CME’s acquisition of the Nex group, which publishes BrokerTec US Treasury benchmarks and EBS foreign exchange benchmarks.

### Swapping ideas

FTSE Russell uses a similar methodology to IBA for its term Sonia rate, with committed swap quotes at the top of the waterfall. Sonia futures listed at Curve Global – also part of LSEG – are in the process of being added as a backup. Curve does not yet list SOFR futures.

“In the UK there’s a clear preference for committed OIS quotes and I think we’d apply the same principles in the US,” says Scott Harman, managing director of fixed income product management at FTSE Russell. “But there are obvious constraints,” he adds. “It’s not unreasonable to assume SOFR futures as the primary input to begin with and you might be able to reinforce that depending on how things unfold.”

Refinitiv includes no futures inputs in its term Sonia waterfall. Instead, it uses negotiable OIS quotes from Tradeweb’s dealer-to-client platform in the event Clob data vanishes. That approach may need rethinking for the US market.

“We continue to evaluate what the ARRC is doing and if there is an opportunity for us to support the industry we would be very keen to do so,” says Jacob Rank-Broadley, director for regulatory and market structure propositions at Refinitiv.

“The market structure is certainly different in the US and the market has further to go in terms of developing liquidity,” he adds. “I think we just have to accept that every market is different and the most important thing with benchmarks is to have consistency where it makes sense, but ultimately you need a rate that’s robust and reflective of that particular market. You’re only going to do that by being sensitive to the structure that exists in each market.”

Markit differs from its rivals by combining transaction data from its MarkitServ processing arm with futures settlement data at the top level of the waterfall.

Swaps data is considered by some to be a more robust input for term RFRs. Forward-looking RFRs represent market expectations of overnight rates in the future. In swap markets, dealers use internal models to derive their own rate expectations from futures and other data, meaning those assumptions are baked into the price streams. Benchmark administrators that use futures data to infer term rates must apply their own set of assumptions to derive expectations from contract prices.

But even if liquidity improves, applying term Sonia methodologies for the US market would require SOFR swaps to be quoted on firm price streams. Currently, these are traded on an RFQ basis. And even in liquid instruments, Clob-based benchmarks have a chequered history in US markets.

Earlier this year, IBA was forced to [expand the input data](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7550766/ice-swap-rate-adds-safety-net-with-tradeweb-quotes) underpinning Ice swap rate – a constant maturity benchmark of Libor interest rate swaps from one to 30 years – beyond order book quotes. The addition of negotiable dealer-to-client data from Tradeweb came after US dollar versions of the rate [failed to publish](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7509006/swaps-benchmark-vanishes-as-traders-flee-firm-price-venues) for the entirety of March, when dealers pulled firm quotes from venues amid whipsawing markets.

CME also publishes a SOFR OIS curve from one to 30 years, using data from CME Clearing. The central counterparty cleared $100 billion notional of SOFR swaps during the first quarter of 2020, though this fell to just $26 billion during the second quarter after the volatility linked to Covid-19 subsided.
