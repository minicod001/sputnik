One small phrase is causing big headaches for banks subject to new accounting standards for credit loss provisioning: “reasonable and supportable”. The phrase refers to the information banks rely on when developing forecasts to determine whether loans on their books have suffered a material increase in credit risk between reporting periods.

For banks, a lot will turn on their definition of those words. It will directly affect the amount of loan loss reserves they need to set aside under [IFRS 9](https://www.risk.net/topics/ifrs-9) and its US equivalent, the Current Expected Credit Loss ([CECL](https://www.risk.net/topics/current-expected-credit-loss-cecl)) standard – new accounting regimes that shift provisioning from incurred credit losses to expected credit losses. In determining these expected credit losses, banks must use predictions about future economic conditions based on “reasonable and supportable” data.

Under IFRS 9, which came into effect during the first quarter of 2018, loss reserves have been [forecast](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5357926/banks-eye-synthetic-securitisation-to-smooth-ifrs-9-loan-loss-volatility) to rise as much as 44% on average from current levels – amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars globally. The rise in provisioning is determined in part by the forward-looking information that goes into banks’ projections. But the lack of an industry-wide definition of what qualifies as “reasonable and supportable” – the type of information, or how far forward it should extend, for example – could result in dangerous grey areas, with different banks interpreting the rules in different ways. The ambiguity in the wording also sets up a potential conflict between banks and auditors, which must sign off on the [forecast](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5357926/banks-eye-synthetic-securitisation-to-smooth-ifrs-9-loan-loss-volatility)s.

“There’s a discussion of what is a reasonable and supportable period, and it makes a big difference,” says Stevan Maglic, head of quantitative risk analytics at Regions Bank. “The industry hasn’t agreed on anything. Some banks are saying reasonable and supportable is a year or two; others are going further out.”

Standard-setters are doing their best to alleviate banks’ concerns over the interpretation of the wording. Kumar Dasgupta, executive director of the IFRS Foundation, the body which oversees the global standards, says: “Are banks expected to come up with a crystal ball? No, of course not. We are asking them to come up with information that they think is reasonable and supportable at that point in time.” Dasgupta points out the “reasonable and supportable” requirement is qualified by language in IFRS 9stating that forecasts need only be based on information that can be obtained “without undue cost or effort”.

A FASB spokesperson points to its own version of the [standard](http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage?cid=1176168232528&acceptedDisclaimer=true). The FASB text acknowledges banks are likely to take different approaches, but denies this is problematic: “Using terms such as reasonable and supportable does not imply a single conclusion or methodology upon which an entity must base its estimate. Different parties using different methodologies do not make a particular estimate unreasonable.”

In practice, however, and with the first reporting date under IFRS 9 for most banks fast approaching, lenders and their auditors must agree a working definition quickly. The challenges are proving to be daunting for both.

### Phase-in period

IFRS 9 requires banks to set aside reserves to cover expected credit losses over 12 months for performing assets, and over the lifetime of impaired loans. Loans are adjudged to be impaired when the lender deems the borrower unlikely to repay the full amount over the loan’s lifetime. Under the old incurred loss accounting standard, IAS 39, banks only needed to set aside reserves when a loan became impaired.

IFRS 9 loss estimates must be recalculated at quarterly intervals to reflect new information about credit and economic conditions gained during each reporting period. The recalculation exercise may not require a complete overhaul of all the assumptions that feed into the projections: banks are allowed to retain their original “reasonable and supportable” assumptions for as long as they consider them applicable.

European banks can phase in their ECL provisions resulting from IFRS 9[over a five-year transition period](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5364231/doubts-cast-on-europes-ifrs-9-transition-period). This is designed to offset the impact of extra provisioning on capital, particularly for banks using the [standardised approach](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5292961/basel-capital-floor-faces-credit-risk-eclipse) to calculate credit risk-weighted assets, for whom the capital-sapping effects of the regime will be magnified.

In order to form an opinion about the validity of lifetime expected loss estimates, a bank’s auditors – which sign off on their financial statements – will need to immerse themselves in the minutiae of the models being used. Auditors will need to test the assumptions and judgements being used in bank macroeconomic forecasting models.

“Risk is a difficult concept. It involves constructing a view of potential future outcomes and assigning probabilities. That’s not the natural competence of the audit profession,” says Adrian Docherty, head of bank advisory at BNP Paribas.

While banks are required to calculate lifetime expected losses for impaired loans, the IFRS standard does not require a detailed estimate for periods that are far in the future; for such periods, an entity may extrapolate projections from available information.

The standard notes that the estimation of expected credit losses depends on the availability of detailed information. As the forecast horizon increases, the availability of detailed information decreases and the degree of judgement required by banks to estimate ECL increases.

For their part, banks will need to demonstrate consistency in their use of forecasting periods. If a bank is capable of forecasting for budgeting and planning purposes over a three-year horizon, its auditor will expect it to be able to construct macroeconomic scenarios that are of similar duration.

“The notion of reasonable and supportable forecasts has to consider a degree of consistency or a degree of corroboration, and being prepared to explain when it’s different,” says Reza van Roosmalen, financial instruments expert in KPMG’s accounting advisory practice.

Some banks have sought to discuss the issue among themselves, with the aim of establishing a common policy. Sweden’s banks, for example, are using the same macroeconomic scenarios for IFRS 9 as they have for capital planning and business planning, says Louise Lindgren, chief risk officer at Lansforsakringar Bank.

“We have had problems regarding the meaning of reasonable and supportable information,” she says. “IFRS 9 does not define reasonable and supportable, and thus Swedish banks have worked toward a common best practice.”

### Mind your Ps and skew

With such a large scope for banks to exercise their own judgement in creating future projections, there is a danger that IFRS 9estimates could be skewed, or even biased. When expected credit losses are linked to economic forecasts, this creates an incentive to distort those forecasts. For example, if an economic forecast predicts a deterioration in the economy in two years, a bank could be tempted to limit its reasonable and supportable forecast period to less than two years so as not to affect current earnings.

The process could even be unintentional, says BNPP’s Docherty. “There is a natural bias toward optimism,” he says. “Most firms that are in the doldrums will have a route map out of that and will convince themselves and their auditors that a downward trend isn’t going to continue. It would be surprising if someone said ‘my view of the future is calamitous, and therefore I’m going to voluntarily have significantly higher provisions than the neutral projections would indicate’.”

Banks have even greater discretion for judgement under CECL. Unlike IFRS 9, CECL explicitly allows a bank to revert to historical loss information for periods where the bank is unable to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts.

“The reversion was created because the question came up: ‘what do I do if I can’t forecast any more?’ The FASB said once you can no longer forecast than you’re allowed to look at historical loss information,” says Jonathan Prejean, managing director at Deloitte.

This gives banks latitude to determine when to revert, which raises the question of whether the decision could be based on short-term expediency. If, for example, a bank’s economic forecasts project a sharp rise in defaults for the next three years, there is little to prevent it from claiming that the forecasts are only valid for one year, after which it can revert to historical – and potentially more favourable – information that would result in lower allowances.

That puts the onus on auditors to root out arbitrary changes in forecast horizons. “The external auditors would not let you change the goalposts,” says Maglic at Regions Bank. “You’re going to have to choose a methodology and a reasonable and supportable period, and you’re not going to be able to move that around. If you move it, it’s going to alert the auditors. You’re going to hurt your credibility.”

Some even recommend that the models used for expected credit losses be subject to the same oversight as the models used to calculate expected losses for regulatory capital purposes.

“If you think about the controls that exist around the models that are used for calculating expected loss, that’s a very controlled process,” says Ian Tyler, managing director of financial industry advisory services at consultancy Alvarez & Marsal. “You can’t even change certain parameters without getting regulatory approval. But the regulators aren’t going to police ECL models, because this is an accounting standard. You need to put in place appropriate governance for the credit models themselves to ensure that they’re not biased.”

Scrutiny of forecast methodologies is likely to be tighter under CECL than IFRS 9, anyway. As CECL requires banks to provision for lifetime losses on all loans, rather than just impaired loans as is the case under IFRS 9, the impact of CECL on US banks could be significantly higher than for banks subject to IFRS 9. US banks may face a cumulative increase of [$50 billion to $100 billion](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/2466928/mind-gaap-us-banks-brace-50-100bn-capital-hit) on their loan loss reserves upon adoption of CECL.

“Under CECL, every single loan gets assigned a lifetime expected loss,” says Laurent Birade, senior risk consultant at SAS. “Therefore, the impact from the determination of a reasonable and supportable forecast will be much greater, and there will be a lot more scrutiny of how you come up with that forecast, a scrutiny that IFRS 9 banks have not been subjected to yet.”

### Default setting

However, even though IFRS 9 only requires lifetime allowances for impaired loans, banks will still be required to calculate probability of default over the lifetime of all loans: that is, they need to identify for all loans whether there is a significant increase in credit risk over their entire lifetime.

“You have to consider whether the risk of default has changed from what it was at origination. You have to look at what you think the macroeconomic impact will be now versus what it was when a loan was originated,” says Jonathan Bingham, a partner at KPMG. “That has been a particular source of difficulty in how you interpret reasonable and supportable.”

For a consumer loan portfolio, the trigger point could be something as simple as whether a loan becomes 30 or 60 days past due. Commercial portfolios could require a more complex calculation, such as an increase in probability of default above a certain threshold, or a decline in credit rating. IFRS 9banks will also need to be prepared to change the status of loans from impaired back to performing.

“Operationally, CECL is more straightforward than IFRS 9,” says Prejean. “In theory, IFRS 9banks get a benefit of a lower allowance especially on consumer portfolios but you do have some increased operational risk having to determine that staging criteria and monitoring it.”
