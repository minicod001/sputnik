{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_OpRisk North America: non-US banks holding less capital under own-models approach was “a big problem”, says regulator_{{< /quote >}}

The Basel Committee’s decision to scrap the use of operational risk modelling in favour of a single standardised approach will help solve the “big problem” of non-US banks holding significantly less capital than their US peers on average, according to a senior US regulator.

Speaking at the OpRisk North America conference earlier this week, Filippo Curti, a financial economist in the supervision, regulation and credit department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond – who was involved in [discussions](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/operational-risk/2479772/fed-economist-advocates-combining-internal-models-with-sma) with the Basel Committee’s operational risk working group during the development of the standardised measurement approach (SMA) – said a wide disparity in capital levels existed between jurisdictions under the existing advanced measurement approach (AMA), making it harder to compare banks.

US regulators have insisted banks choosing to use an own-models approach to calculate op risk capital requirements must follow a strict [loss-distribution approach](http://www.risk.net/comment/5362691/how-to-save-op-risk-modelling). By contrast, European banks have generally been permitted to make greater use of more subjective techniques such as scenario generation, which, with a regulator’s approval, could be used to demonstrate a lower incidence of potential loss for a given risk factor, and hence lower capital requirements.

Stressing his views were strictly his own, rather than those of his employer, Curti said: “Many of you know that I’ve been working with Basel, looking at the quantitative impact studies there… What I can tell you is, the capital levels [between banks] were very, very different. If you were to take two banks from different jurisdictions with the exact same losses, you would have seen very different capital. It is obvious to everyone in this room which jurisdiction was stricter, and which was less strict… so I think it was a problem. It was a big problem.”

Under the AMA, banks were afforded the freedom to balance four elements – internal loss data, external loss data, scenarios, and business environment and internal control factors – when setting capital requirements. Different regulators have diverging views on the efficacy of such an approach, however – leading to wildly different capital standards for banks of a similar size and loss profile as those in the peer group, based simply on location.

Implementation even differed between European jurisdictions, Curti pointed out: “If you were to look at an Italian bank versus a German bank, for example, there was a big difference there as well – so not just US and non-US, but even within Europe, there were very different capital levels [given] comparable losses. So, as much as I may be critical of the SMA – and I’m also critical of the AMA as well – I think the SMA, one thing [it does] is try to level the field, which was the original goal.”

The SMA imposes a highly simplified [standardised approach](https://www.risk.net/topics/standardised-measurement-approach-sma), which dictates a bank’s capital requirements largely as a function of their size by revenue via the so-called business indicator (BI) component. Some risk sensitivity is afforded by scaling requirements according to the losses a bank has suffered over the previous 10 years.

As a result, larger European banks migrating from the AMA to the SMA are [tipped](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/5371581/basel-iii-final-op-risk-framework-leaves-banks-guessing) to see a sharp rise in capital, while US banks will on average see falls. An [impact study](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d426.pdf) released by Basel in December showed a wide disparity between the largest banks, with one large bank seeing a 222% rise in op risk capital, and another seeing a 66% drop. Several major factors could have a bearing on a bank’s final capital number, however – not least national regulators’ discretion to let banks [ignore the impact](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/5462551/ubs-hoping-for-capital-relief-for-past-op-risk-losses) of past losses on their capital number, as well as their attitude to topping up a bank’s minimum required capital using a higher [Pillar 2](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/5400406/pillar-2-moves-to-centre-stage-for-op-risk-capital) requirement.

Curti echoed the [concerns](http://www.risk.net/comment/5287371/dont-let-the-sma-kill-op-risk-modelling) of many in the industry in arguing that, in the quest for simplicity, the SMA does away with too many freedoms that helped capture the idiosyncrasies of a bank’s individual risk profile, therefore making it too blunt an instrument.

“I’ve been critical of the SMA – as many know, I proposed [a different way](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/operational-risk/2479772/fed-economist-advocates-combining-internal-models-with-sma) – but at least it’s an attempt to level the playing field. Now, it levels the field in a way that is based on the BI, and not really the risks that the rest of the bank is taking. Maybe someone else can argue, ‘well, these two banks are the same size, with the same BI, but really they’re taking different risks, so they should have different capital’ – yes, that should be included in the loss [component]. If it’s a pendulum, we go from one side to the other.”

Curti suggested the [calibration of the SMA](https://www.risk.net/regulation/basel-committee/2474759/tweaks-to-standard-op-risk-method-not-enough-experts-warn) was not a direct attempt to increase capital requirements for European banks – an issue which caused transatlantic tensions between opposing camps of regulators while a deal was being [thrashed out](http://www.risk.net/regulation/5360891/basel-heading-for-rotten-compromise-warns-german-lawmaker) over the final Basel III framework.

“There are some good things about the SMA, as well as some bad things. That particular aspect – levelling the playing field so European banks will hold more capital – I don’t think was meant to push European banks to hold more capital… It’s not that anyone said, ‘oh, we need to increase European banks’ capital and decrease US banks’ capital’ – it was trying to make a level field,” said Curti.
