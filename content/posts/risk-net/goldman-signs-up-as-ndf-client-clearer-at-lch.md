Goldman Sachs is set to become the seventh dealer to offer client clearing for non-deliverable forwards at LCH's ForexClear, ahead of what the US bank expects will be a surge in demand for the service from buy-side firms when they become subject to the non-cleared margin rules.

The bank is counting on hedge funds and asset managers subject to the upcoming initial margin requirement to lead the way, but expects the motivation for clearing will eventually extend beyond the regulation.

“The primary impetus for clients is going to be a regulatory push. But as the product becomes more mature and more trades are cleared, I think we are going to see other clients opt into it purely because of the efficiencies they will realise,” says Alicia Crighton, head of OTC clearing at Goldman Sachs.

The bank joins six other dealers offering to clear client NDF trades through LCH: Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale.

The non-cleared margin rules required NDFs to be subject to variation margin [from March 2017](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/3944816/hazy-guidance-causes-chaos-on-first-day-of-vm-regime), with the initial margin requirement being phased in over time. The rules are designed so that the initial margin requirement on non-cleared trades is higher than for cleared positions, with the aim of incentivising the use of central counterparties.

“We would expect most of our larger clients to be looking to move to this model,” says Crighton, adding that those primed to clear NDFs will do so on a voluntary basis before they fall under the regulation.

Not all buy-side firms are convinced about the idea of clearing NDFs in the short term, however.

“We do not intend to clear those and haven’t really considered it. I see the pros in terms of counterparty risk, but it’s an operational work that we cannot put in place at the moment,” says a trader at one European asset manager.

The initial margin requirement caught dealers first in 2016 and 2017, then hedge fund [Brevan Howard](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5867231/brevan-howard-is-first-non-bank-caught-by-margin-rules-sources-say) in September 2018, and a slew of other hedge funds [in 2019](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6165346/hedge-fund-giants-lead-fourth-wave-of-im-candidates). But the so-called big bang of smaller derivatives users has yet to mmaterialise

Less than a year after recommending that what was then the final implementation phase be split in two, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organization of Securities Commissions recommended in April that the final phases each be delayed a year as a result of operational [disruption](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7513521/industry-calls-for-suspension-of-im-compliance-dates) caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The new timetable, if adopted by local regulators, means firms with over-the-counter derivatives exceeding €50 billion in average aggregate notional amount (AANA) would come into scope in phase five in September 2021, and those with between €8 billion and €50 billion would be caught in phase six in September 2022. Physical FX forwards are excluded from AANA totals but NDFs add to the overall sum.

Average daily NDF trading nearly doubled between 2016 and 2019, reaching $258 billion, according to the latest triennial FX survey released by the Bank for International Settlements.

LCH says it clears roughly half of all interbank NDF volumes as of June 2020. The central counterparty clears NDFs for 12 emerging market currency pairs and five G10 pairs.

Monthly NDF cleared volumes at LCH jumped when the dealers were brought into scope of the initial margin rules but have remained relatively steady at around $1.5 trillion in the past two years (see figure 1). March saw a spike in trades pass through the clearing house as several pairs saw [record flows](https://www.fx-markets.com/tech-and-data/7533941/fx-options-ndfs-trading-slows-as-covid-fears-ease) amid broader market volatility. The figures include both legs of cleared trades.
