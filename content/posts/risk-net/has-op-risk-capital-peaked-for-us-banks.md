> _Analysts expect steady fall in biggest banks’ $1.4 trillion in RWAs_

Operational risk capital – for so long the bane of big US banks – may finally have passed its high-water mark, as the pace of fines racked up for crisis-era misdeeds starts to abate.

Three of the big five US banks [reported falls](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/5594001/share-of-op-risk-rwas-at-us-banks-falls)in operational risk-weighted assets (RWAs) during the first quarter of 2018: at Citi, the drop was $2.5 billion; at Goldman Sachs it was $3.3 billion; at Morgan Stanley, $178 million (see figure 1). The totals for JP Morgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch were both static.

Op risk capital experts say the falls are not due to large losses dropping out of the data histories used in bank capital models – instead, it is because these losses are now happening less frequently.

“As we move away from the crisis, more benign losses are coming in that are essentially rebalancing your data set,” says one bank lobbyist.

A senior op risk practitioner says this should produce a gradual slide in capital for most large US banks: “As long as the economic environment remains good, and losses remain in the ‘normal’ range – which is non-crisis-era-sized losses – we should observe a continuous erosion of that number. It’ll be a slow erosion – up to 0.5–1% each quarter at most – but it could keep going for some time, as banks readjust their internal loss frequencies.”

The latest quarterly falls continued a recent trend. In total, op risk RWAs for the big five US banks have fallen by roughly $30 billion since peaking at just under $1.5 trillion at the end of 2015. For the industry as a whole, publicly reported op risk losses [peaked](https://www.risk.net/comment/5384771/top-10-op-risk-losses-of-2017-crisis-era-fines-abate) at $95 billion in 2014, according to data from ORX News – in 2017, the loss total was $23 billion (see figure 2).

If op risk capital has peaked, it will be welcome news for bank chiefs, who had been frustrated by their inability to do anything about the growing capital burden. Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s chief executive, famously called for op risk capital rules to be “significantly modified, if not eliminated” in his annual letter to shareholders last year.

Unlike market and credit risk, banks can do little to manage down their op risk capital once losses have occurred – regulators do not allow big events to be ‘forgotten’ unless there are [exceptional circumstances](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/5364236/banks-await-basel-decision-on-legacy-op-risk-losses), such as the full divestment of a business entity. In Switzerland, the domestic supervisor, Finma, this year allowed Credit Suisse to [cut $11 billion](http://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/5549596/finma-grants-capital-relief-to-credit-suisse-resolution-unit) in RWAs to divested businesses, such as its US private bank – but experts say the US Federal Reserve is not likely to follow suit.

“Any loss that’s in your database has to remain there forever. You’re not going to see them doing something like they did in Switzerland for Credit Suisse,” says the senior op risk practitioner.

The models themselves may also be frozen in time. Even though the loss data is changing, the Federal Reserve is said to have no appetite to review and approve substantial alterations to the models, given the advanced measurement approach (AMA) regime is due to be scrapped and the models replaced.

“The US is not revising or reviewing AMA models anymore. At most, they'll consider very small revisions, as long as they do not result in any meaningful change to your RWAs,” says one person familiar with the supervisor’s thinking.

The Fed declined to comment.

### Less-frequent catastrophes

So, what is driving the falls? The three banks that saw first-quarter falls offer similar explanations. Citi says it stemmed from “changes in operational loss severity and frequency”, while Morgan Stanley says it was due to “a reduction in the internal loss frequency related to litigation utilised in [its] operational risk capital model”. Goldman’s chief financial officer, Marty Chavez, said during the bank’s earnings call that it had seen a “continuing roll-off” in operational RWAs, but did not say why.

Most US banks employ a so-called loss distribution approach (LDA) to calculating op risk capital. This is dominated by two components: the severity of losses a bank has suffered, and the frequency with which they occur. When a bank suffers a [record loss](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/operational-risk/2244456/legally-blind-huge-settlements-overwhelm-op-risk-models), the upper bound of its loss distribution gets pushed out further.

A bank’s loss frequency is measured as the number of annualised loss events it has suffered above a given threshold. Banks can set this threshold where they like, provided their regulator agrees. Citi, for instance, is understood to set its threshold at $20,000 – meaning losses under this amount will not be factored into its AMA model. Citi did not comment when approached.

Op risk loss events fall into two broad categories: low-frequency, high-impact losses, such as large regulatory fines or [rogue trading](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/5423351/top-10-op-risks-2018-unauthorised-trading) losses; and high-frequency, low-impact losses, such as relatively low-level thefts or frauds still large enough to trip a bank’s threshold.

Under the LDA, individual losses do not get averaged, explains one op risk quant; rather, banks take an annualised moving average of their loss frequencies over a given time horizon – typically three years – with the total sum of loss severities within the sample then used to estimate required capital. This procedure is repeated at least a thousand times, with the top 1,000th sample by size, measured to a 99.9% confidence level, the one that gets used – a very conservative measure.

For the three banks in question, the largest event in their respective loss histories is likely to be the settlement they reached with US authorities over the misselling of mortgage-backed securities during the 2000s. Citi [settled](https://www.risk.net/media/download/932721/download) at a cost of $7 billion in 2014; [Goldman](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/2457373/nine-years-later-rmbs-woes-still-haunt-banks), $5 billion in 2016; and Morgan Stanley $3.2 billion.

“Regulators have made it clear over and over again that banks must use ‘fat-tailed’ distributions in their op risk models to be able to capture large losses,” says one op risk quant. “The larger the losses, the ‘fatter’ or more ‘heavy-tailed’ the distribution. Distributions that are commonly used in op risk modelling are much wider than those used in market and credit risk modelling.”

This highly conservative approach means banks have to retain outsize loses; their LDA model’s loss distribution will be skewed by their severity. But the frequency component of the LDA model means they are not the only determinant of a bank’s op risk capital. As new data gets added to a bank’s rolling average of annualised loss frequencies, those outsized losses look less and less likely to recur.

This smoothing effect will translate into a gradual roll-down of RWAs, providing no new clusters of large losses are added.

“As the new data comes in, you use the same models, but you recalibrate them with the new quarters of data. And the recalibration is basically telling the model that the frequency of loss events is going down,” says the op risk quant. “That makes especial sense for Morgan Stanley and Goldman, which only became Fed-regulated in 2008. Their data sets are shorter than, say, Bank of America’s; it means their data was heavily skewed by data from the crisis.”

Provided the three banks in question have not adjusted their rolling average time horizon, then the decreases they each saw in the first quarter are likely to point to a decrease in loss frequencies. Citi, for instance, is understood to have seen around a 50% drop in op risk events triggering its loss threshold in the past couple of years.

“I don’t know if [the three banks] have revised those time periods. If that time window has been stable, then any fall in RWAs likely points to a fall in the frequency of loss events – probably high-frequency, low-impact losses. That has a relevant impact. The high-impact losses are still happening, but there are fewer of them, too, particularly fines,” says one bank lobbyist.

If the Fed decided to turn away requests for AMA changes, however, the best banks can hope for is a gradual roll-down in RWAs, rather than any dramatic falls.

“There’s an understanding that some banks’ models need some sprucing up right now – data has changed and all that – but it would take too much time to review them,” says the bank lobbyist. “And since the AMA is basically dead, why spend any more time and precious resources reviewing something we know you can only use for a certain amount of time? So you might as well just use what you have now, even if it’s imperfect.”

Morgan Stanley declined to provide a comment. Goldman did not respond to a request for comment.
