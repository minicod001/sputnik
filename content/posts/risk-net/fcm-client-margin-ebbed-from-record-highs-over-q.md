Aggregate required client margin for swaps trades held by US futures commissions merchants (FCMs) declined $5.4 billion (-4%) over the three months to end-June, having climbed a record [$34.8 billion](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7563331/client-margin-up-40-at-morgan-stanleys-swaps-unit-in-q1) the prior quarter. Still, year-to-date required margin was up a whopping 25%.

Goldman Sachs was the only one of the eight largest FCMs to post a meaningful increase in required margin quarter-on-quarter, of $837 million (+8%). Citi, the largest FCM, saw required margin amounts pare back 5% to $36 billion, while its close rival Morgan Stanley posted an 8% decline to $27.3 billion.

Barclays recorded the largest percentage-wise decline of the top firms, with margin amounts falling 16% to $7.5 billion.

Excess margin, amounts held by FCMs surplus to requirements, also fell over the quarter, by 17% to $6.6 billion.

FCM swaps margin was slightly less concentrated at the top eight firms at end-June compared to three months prior. Together they accounted for 96.1% of the total, down from 96.4% as of March.

### What is it?

The [Commodity Futures Trading Commission](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/financialfcmdata/index.htm?utm_source=govdelivery) requires FCMs to file monthly financial reports with the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight. Selected data from these reports are made available publicly, including information on FCMs’ net capital, customer segregated funds and required margin.

The above graphs use data extracted from the ‘customer amount cleared swap segregated – required’ field in the monthly reports. This data denotes the amount of funds an FCM is required to segregate for customers who trade cleared swaps.

### Why it matters

Required margin amounts surged in Q1 in response to the unprecedented market volatility unleashed by the coronavirus crisis. It’s also likely that financial institutions and corporates alike reset their hedging programmes at the outset of the pandemic to account for the sharp drop in global interest rates, pushing overall swaps volumes higher.

Markets calmed over the second quarter, and traders are confident that rates volatility has been tamed by the actions of central banks, which are preoccupied with keeping borrowing costs low to support their struggling host economies.

This likely explains some of the decline in required margin over the three months to end-June. Margin models, reacting to the normalisation of risk levels, produced lower requirements for clearing bank clients. In addition, some firms may have offloaded hedges put on at the start of the crisis they no longer believe they need.

Certain FCMs, though, may have been able to capitalise on the surge in activity over Q1 to win new clients or encourage them to trade more derivatives on their platform. This may, perhaps, explain why some FCMs, like Goldman, produced quarter-on-quarter increases in required margin against the trend.
