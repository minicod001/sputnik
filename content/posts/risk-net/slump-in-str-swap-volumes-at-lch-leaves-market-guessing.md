When volumes in swaps linked to the euro short-term rate (€STR) fell off dramatically in March, traders expected to see a V-shaped recovery. Four months later, many are scratching their heads about why they are still languishing.

Total monthly €STR swap volumes at LCH peaked at €181.31 billion ($213 billion) notional in February before collapsing to €8.72 billion in May. In June, volumes rebounded to €63.99 billion – not even half the February level.

The common explanation is that many market participants turned to Eonia – the more established and liquid euro risk-free rate – during the height of the Covid-19 crisis.

“Why didn’t a lot of people think about €STR? I think it’s just old habits,” says a head of global rates at a European Bank.

Others say operational delays may have contributed to the decline in €STR volumes. “People have yet to build the curves that directly reference €STR screens [and] settle off the correct feeding €STR rate,” said Tom Prickett, co-head of rates trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at JP Morgan. “These are all plumbing, mechanics that are still being put in place for some people, meaning it’s easier to trade Eonia.”

Prickett was speaking on a panel at Risk.net’s Libor Virtual Week in June.

But that doesn’t explain why €STR overnight index swap volumes at Eurex have been going in the other direction. After a drop from €15.47 billion in January to €6.65 billion in February, the Frankfurt-based clearing house has seen volumes increase steadily to €32.75 billion in June.

Volumes are expected to jump this week. On July 27, central counterparties began [using €STR instead of Eonia to discount future cashflows](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7527801/clearing-houses-postpone-euro-discounting-switch-to-july) and calculate interest payments on collateral – known as price alignment interest – for euro-denominated interest rate swaps.

Some in the market were unperturbed by the slump in volumes ahead of the discounting switch. “Liquidity in Eonia swaps should be treated as liquidity in €STR swaps due to the fixed link between the two,” says Jaap Kes, head of market risks and execution at ING Group Treasury. “The change in price alignment interest and discounting for cleared swaps and the upcoming end-date of Eonia will push all liquidity to the €STR markets, so I am not concerned about this short-term trend.”

Eonia is due to be phased out at the end of 2021 and has already been recalibrated to reference €STR – its replacement rate – plus a spread of 8.5 basis points. The discounting switch is seen as crucial to embedding the new risk-free rate in the financial system. As dealers typically hedge their discounting liabilities with overnight index swaps, the move is expected to boost liquidity in the new rate.

Euribor, the main benchmark for euro swaps, has been [deemed compliant](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6609986/critical-eu-benchmarks-to-be-approved-by-year-end) with the European Union’s Benchmarks Regulation and will continue to be published past 2022.

The next two months could be crucial in determining where liquidity coalesces. “Currently, six-month Euribor will be here to stay for at least five years if you ask me. But my interest will be in a liquid market as much as possible,” said Max Verheijen, director of financial markets at pension fund asset manager Cardano, speaking on a different panel at the Libor Virtual Week event.

“I don't want a market that’s bifurcated towards, let’s say, swaps versus six-month Euribor and swaps versus €STR,” he added. “The industry has to make a choice. Where do you want to make the liquidity that we can use as an industry to hedge the duration?”

Others are convinced the market will plump for €STR. Volumes linked to Euribor tanked in March and only began to pick back up in six-month and longer tenors in June.

“As a result, most of the observations that went into Euribor over that period, in the three-month and six-month tenors would have been over 80% into level three – so effectively expert-judgment based, which invariably means model based and not based on actual transactions,” says a trader at one liability-driven investment fund.

“And for us, that’s an inherent vulnerability of the rate that hasn’t really been addressed by the regulators pinning their colors to Euribor,” he adds. “Ultimately, we're not seeing a major shift in the way the market functions to suddenly bring back a vast amount of unsecured money market volume.”
