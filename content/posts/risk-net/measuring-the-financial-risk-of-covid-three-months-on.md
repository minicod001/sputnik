At the onset of the Covid-19 lockdown in Europe and the US, Risk.net asked its readers to estimate the impact on a series of key risk factors. Those views became the inputs to a set of unique crowd-sourced stress scenarios – an open-source attempt to put a dollar value on financial exposures in the face of radical uncertainty.

Contributed opinions were vital in helping us build a view of what our readers think the next six months could look like; [click here](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7552516/covid-scenarios-finding-the-worst-worst-case) to view the results of the first survey, and the [economic scenarios](https://www.risk.net/media/download/1044211) generated using readers’ responses.

With many countries now emerging from lockdown, we want to know how opinions have shifted – so, we’re running a follow-up. We are seeking a diversity of opinions, and yours is important: let us know your views by taking our two-minute survey, and receive an exclusive preview of the results once voting closes.

[Click here to be part of the crowd and take the survey](https://www.surveygizmo.eu/s3/90249788/Financial-Risk-Covid-II).

As before, all individual responses will remain strictly confidential and anonymous. No details of respondents will be published.

The six-month forecasts of individual risk factors are knitted into multi-factor scenarios by RiskThinking.ai, our vendor partner, founded by Ron Dembo. His approach is to focus on the more extreme views garnered from respondents – both positive and negative – with the aim of capturing outcomes that may have been missed by conventional or regulator-defined approaches to scenario generation.

The approach is unconventional – but, [Dembo argues](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7544646/qa-ron-dembo-on-crowd-spotting-black-swans), all the more effective for it.

Risk managers of all stripes have found themselves turning to [stress testing](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7655551/lme-distressed-at-severity-of-esma-stress-tests) techniques in the last few months. Credit risk managers are [stressing loan books](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7511401/as-covid-snaps-credit-models-lenders-turn-to-stress-testing), no longer trusting the outputs of probability of default models for companies whose prospects have been wrecked by lockdown; op risk managers are [using scenario generation](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7561696/banks-eye-post-pandemic-shake-up-of-op-risk-scenarios) to enhance post-pandemic business continuity planning; investors [are embracing](https://www.risk.net/investing/7658331/before-and-after-the-covid-19-storm-buy-side-risk-survey) hypothetical scenarios over backward-looking risk measures; clearing houses are upping their use of [stress testing](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7655551/lme-distressed-at-severity-of-esma-stress-tests) to assess members’ margin coverage, with models suffering an unprecedented number of [breaches](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7506216/coronavirus-rout-revives-attacks-on-futures-margining) during March’s market meltdown.
