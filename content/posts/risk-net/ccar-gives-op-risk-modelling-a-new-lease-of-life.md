{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_OpRisk North America: Fed’s annual stress tests are rehabilitating ‘black box’ op risk modelling_{{< /quote >}}

The US Federal Reserve’s annual stress tests for large banks may have accomplished what the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision could not: legitimising the field of operational risk modelling.

The committee’s advanced measurement approach (AMA) for operational risk – which is being scrapped in favour of a simpler, standardised approach – allowed banks to use their own models to calculate regulatory capital charges. However, AMA models were often perceived as ‘black boxes’ that failed to reflect the way bankers think about operational risk.

“We’ve been more successful in getting buy-in for the way we measure losses for CCAR [the Fed’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review] than for capital, because with CCAR, we tap into the existing BAU [business as usual] processes and the way the lines of business think about the loss-generating mechanisms,” said Nedim Baruh, head of operational risk measurement and analytics at JP Morgan.

Baruh was speaking on a panel at the OpRisk North America conference in New York yesterday (March 20).

CCAR requires banks to identify operational risks using scenario analysis. But unlike with the AMA, risk managers, business heads and senior executives now have a direct say in how these scenarios are constructed.

“Too many people in the businesses saw scenario output being thrown into a black box [under the AMA],” said Evan Sekeris, a partner in the financial services practice at Oliver Wyman. “Now, there is significantly more involvement because there’s a tangible causal effect. Because they are part of the risk identification process, it forces them to identify the different control failures and provides useful information on areas of improvement.”

CCAR is also forcing banks to devise new ways to model emerging operational risks – such as cyber threats – that may not have materialised yet in loss histories.

“We are coming up with more innovative ways to model risk,” said Justin Hahn, head of internal capital adequacy and assessment process at Deutsche Bank. “Modelling cyber security risk is not something we would’ve been hearing about two or three years ago.”

Deustche Bank has also established so-called “uncertainty buffers” around the amount of op risk-weighted assets associated with a business line based on the quality of information it provides for stress-testing purposes.

“It’s very convincing when you start to tie losses to RWAs and capital,” said Hahn. “A very motivating factor is to say, ‘The more ambiguous the output I’m getting, the more it will result in uncertainty buffers that we end up layering on to your business or segment, which directly impacts the P&L of your business’.”

Banks are also finding that much of the op risk modelling needed for CCAR is already being performed by various business units within them. For instance, the consumer banking division has models for estimating losses associated with credit card fraud, while the legal department quantifies potential losses arising from litigation and regulatory fines.

“These segments of potential losses can be measured using existing information that is part of BAU processes within the bank,” said Baruh.

JP Morgan segments op risk losses into three buckets: recurring losses; large, infrequent losses such as legal settlements and regulatory penalties; and idiosyncratic losses that have relatively little loss history such as cyber breaches. It then leverages existing bank processes for collecting data on these losses, Baruh said.

Op risk modelling will continue to improve as banks refine their approach to CCAR, Sekeris said: “We’re not fully there yet. A lot of the CCAR machinery has been built around the macro drivers and not as much on firm-specific drivers, but over time we will move in that direction.”
