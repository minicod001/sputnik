> _Firms seek better handle on impact of global shocks, and hope to avert regulatory attention_

Covid-19 has forced banks to revisit their assumptions about the impact that pandemics can have on every aspect of their business – not least, their operational risk frameworks. While practitioners fear the full effects of the crisis will take years to get their arms around, many are already revising the scenarios used for capital planning and stress-testing. Their objective is to better anticipate the range and severity of future shocks, to bolster resilience – and avoid regulatory intervention.

Despite spending millions of dollars a year on vendor and bespoke applications for op risk [scenario generation](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/6767536/aba-scenario-analysis-project-could-aid-ccar-comparability), banks acknowledge their scenarios signally failed to prepare them for the pandemic.

Op risk scenarios have typically considered events – such as a blackout or terrorist attack – in isolation. And, more often than not, impacts have been regional, rather than global. Banks would have assigned such a low probability to a global pandemic as to ignore it.

They now need to consider not only the probability of a pandemic-level disaster, but the second-order impacts it could have on other risks.

“Across the industry, many banks have generated scenarios that are narrower in scope because catastrophic scenarios are seen as too extreme, and there’s the question of how do these scenarios overlap with economic scenarios,” says Evan Sekeris, head of model validation at PNC Financial Group.

“The pandemic is a perfect example where you have a true op risk event, but it also triggers a macroeconomic event.”

Firms now face the challenge of [incorporating](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7552516/covid-scenarios-finding-the-worst-worst-case) the effects of a pandemic into the risk assessment process. They must decide between upgrading their standalone scenarios for pandemic risk or treating it as an event that can trigger other operational risks, such as rogue trading, mis-selling, fraud and physical attacks.

“Is a pandemic a separate risk or a stress on other scenarios? We’re just starting to discuss that and how to deal with that in the construct of our existing frameworks,” says the head of op risk quant at one large bank.

The goal is not so much trying to assign probabilities to specific events, but instead to ask what happens, should an event occur. Op risk professionals say the inventory and types of scenario and attendant narratives are likely to undergo revisions – without necessarily changing the likelihood of the scenario actually happening.

“The key is to think about the risks that you’re facing, and making sure the inventory of scenarios reflects those risks,” says an operational risk expert at a large US bank.

“The whole point of the exercise when you have large-tailed events is it helps push thinking further out on the tail.”

### Get involved

Risk.net is running a crowd-sourced project to help readers gauge the economic damage that could result from Covid-19, as measured by your estimates of the pandemic’s impact on key financial indicators.

We are seeking a diversity of opinions, and yours is important: let us know your views by taking our two minute survey, and receive an exclusive preview of the results once voting closes.

So, rather than a set of standalone scenarios for individual risks, the focus will be on creating scenarios for multiple interlinked events.

“Our scenario analysis work will now account for multiple events with simultaneous scenarios – given the ongoing Covid pandemic, coupled with civil unrest,” says Gus Ortega, head of operational risk management at Voya Financial.

“People will treat [a] pandemic as a causal environmental factor that affects the portfolio of scenarios, rather than articulating a standalone scenario,” adds an operational risk executive at a large UK bank. “If you do a standalone scenario, you end up building an artificial representation.”

### Knock-on effects

Although firms were able to handle well some of the unanticipated consequences of the pandemic – the transition to working from home being a prime example – they felt the underestimation of impact in various areas.

Among these was credit card fraud, when artificial intelligence fraud detection systems were overwhelmed [by a large number of false positives](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7520706/covid-19-frazzles-ai-fraud-systems), owing to radical changes in customer behaviour patterns, such as shopping online instead of in person. In some cases, banks have had to completely shut down their machine learning-based systems and use manual processes instead.

The speed with which banks are introducing products under government stimulus programmes also increases the risk of conduct-related losses, as they face [lawsuits for mis-selling](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7533606/emergency-covid-loans-carry-high-mis-selling-risk-banks-fear). Banks say there is an increased risk of operational failures associated with processing the surging volumes of loan applications from individuals and small businesses.

Execution risk also increased significantly as financial markets collapsed then rebounded. “The pandemic was a very low-probability scenario in pretty much all firms, and not much thought was put into this scenario – therefore, there was indeed an underestimation of the impacts,” says Marcelo Cruz, a risk management consultant.

One of his clients, a large broker, saw its operational risk morph into credit and market exposures when its system could not match its clients’ orders because of large volumes. The broker had to honour the prices the clients entered, producing a significant financial loss.

“The experience has provided us [with] tremendous information in understanding how a pandemic impacts the world and our customers, as well as the institution itself,” says the op risk quant.

### Regulatory reach

Banks say stress scenario planning for the purposes of operational resilience – which was already a concern of regulators, pre-pandemic – has now risen to the top of their agenda. While most firms have been shown to be resilient during the present crisis, the possibility of a second wave, coupled with a prolonged recession, will mean regulatory scrutiny will intensify.

Last year, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision signalled its intention to [update its operational resilience principles](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/6747901/basel-set-to-update-op-risk-and-resilience-principles), and the US Federal Reserve had plans to issue its own guidance. But those steps had not been taken when Covid-19 struck. In the absence of fully fledged resilience programmes, banks have had to fall back on existing business continuity plans that are designed to address point-in-time situations, rather than the long-term events that are unfolding today.

“The ideal scenario would have been to build an op resilience framework and then … a chance to test the framework. But no-one’s finished with the framework, so we got locked into crisis management,” says Sam Lee, head of operational risk for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Sumitomo Mitsui.

While banks have come through with little intervention so far, they expect regulators to make the push to address resilience with renewed vigour over the coming months.

“At the macro op resilience level, which is where all regulators want to get to, it’s going to be an interesting exercise which transcends individual banks. What they’ll be doing is make sure the banks have finished their op resilience framework,” concludes Lee.
