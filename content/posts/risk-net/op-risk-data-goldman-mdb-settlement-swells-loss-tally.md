July’s largest loss saw Goldman Sachs announce that it had reached an agreement with the Malaysian government to settle criminal proceedings relating to the bank’s involvement in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fraud. Goldman Sachs agreed to [pay $2.5 billion](https://www.goldmansachs.com/media-relations/press-releases/current/announcement-24-july-2020.html) to resolve the proceedings – the government had been seeking as much as $7.5 billion – and agreed to return at least $1.4 billion in proceeds from assets linked to 1MDB.

Goldman’s fine is by far the largest op risk loss recorded by ORX News during 2020 to date, dwarfing all losses reported between March and June in its own right (see figure 1). In part, this reflects an [abnormally quiet](https://www.risk.net/comment/7652866/op-risk-data-losses-plummet-during-lockdown) period for reported losses during Covid-enforced lockdown, when regulatory penalties and settlement activity slowed to a crawl, and no large fines were meted out.

1MDB was a sovereign wealth fund created in 2009 by the Malaysian government, which lost up to $5.7 billion as the result of a $4.5 billion fraud carried out by its executives between 2009 and 2015. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), former Goldman Sachs executive Tim Leissner helped the fund raise $6.5 billion in bond offerings.

Through 2012 and 2013, Leissner and other senior executives at Goldman Sachs worked to obtain and retain business from 1MDB for the benefit of Goldman Sachs through the promise and payment of bribes and kickbacks to government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. These payments were financed, in part, by embezzled proceeds from the bond deals.

Over the course of the scheme, the SEC estimates that Leissner and others misappropriated more than $2.7 billion, used as bribes and kickbacks to those government officials. Leissner also misrepresented transactions and assets in Goldman Sachs’s books and personally received more than $43 million in illicit payments for his role in this scheme, the SEC claims.

In return, the government agreed to withdraw criminal charges and not bring further charges against the bank, its subsidiaries and its staff, excluding Leissner and Robert Ng, who were charged by the US Department of Jucrises

In July’s second-largest loss, Deutsche Bank agreed to [pay $150 million](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr202007071) over compliance failures relating to [its relationship](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7654716/stuart-lewis-deutsches-survivor-confronts-covid-19) with the late convicted criminal Jeffrey Epstein and with Danske Bank Estonia and FBME Bank.

The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) found that Deutsche Bank had failed to properly monitor account activity conducted on behalf of Epstein despite the publicly reported information about his criminal misconduct.

Despite the bank marking its relationship with Epstein as “high-risk” and designating him an “honorary political exposed person”, it did not subject his accounts to the necessary enhanced due diligence. As such, several payments to individuals, who were publicly alleged to have been co-conspirators in Epstein’s crimes, received payments from his accounts at the bank, which were not subject to enhanced due diligence.

The NYDFS’s fine also relates to Deutsche Bank’s relationship with [Danske Bank Estonia](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/6470126/top-10-op-risks-2019) and FBME Bank. The NYDFS found that Deutsche Bank had not acted on red flags concerning these banks’ anti-money laundering measures. Both banks were deemed high-risk, and Deutsche Bank was warned of the risks of doing business with these banks. However, Deutsche Bank regularly processed billions of dollars’ worth of payments on behalf of the banks.

Valic Financial Advisors saw July’s third-largest loss, [paying $40 million](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-164) to settle two actions filed by the SEC. The SEC alleged that VFA failed to disclose that its parent company paid for VFA to be promoted to teachers, and secondly that VFA failed to disclose conflicts of interest regarding financial benefits it received as a result of its choice of mutual fund investments.

As a result of this conduct, VFA received over $13.2 million in financial benefits. As of July 28, 2020, VFA had repaid clients approximately $2.3 million in fees, plus interest.

The first order required VFA agree to a censure, refrain from future violations and pay a civil money penalty of $20 million. The second order required VFA pay $20 million in disgorgement, pre-judgement interest and a civil money penalty.

July’s fourth-largest loss occurred at Credit Suisse, which reportedly agreed to settle a class action brought by investors in four pension funds for $15.5 million.

The dispute concerned two writedowns Credit Suisse made in early 2016 totalling $633 million on a series of collateralised loan obligations and distressed debt products. As a result of the writedowns, the value of Credit Suisse American depositary receipts (ADRs) fell by 11%, wiping out approximately $23 million in the bank’s market capitalisation. This led to significant losses on investors’ holdings of Credit Suisse ADRs.

The pension funds alleged Credit Suisse had misled its shareholders prior to the writedowns, by stating in filings that it maintained “comprehensive risk management processes and sophisticated control systems governing its investment operations”. The complainants alleged that on at least three occasions, Credit Suisse had “redefined”, “increased” or “retired and replaced” its risk limits to accommodate its growing risk exposure.

As of July 2020, the settlement required the approval of a federal court in Manhattan.

In July’s fifth-largest loss, UBS [paid out $10 million](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-159) over allegations it had circumvented the priority given to retail investors in certain municipal bond offerings between August 2012 and June 2016.

According to the SEC, UBS representatives improperly allocated bonds on multiple orders intended for retail customers to parties known in the industry as ‘flippers’, who then immediately resold or ‘flipped’ the bonds to other broker-dealers at a profit. Executives often included false zip codes with the retail orders that were not associated with the relevant accounts, in order to meet the issuers’ definition of retail priority.

As a result of this scheme, UBS made a total profit of $5.2 million, by circumventing the priority of orders and giving UBS improper access to a higher priority in the bond allocation process.

The SEC’s order imposed a $1.75 million civil penalty, $6.8 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and $1.5 million in pre-judgement interest.

### Spotlight: Aussie banks pay for underpaying staff

Over the course of 2019 and 2020, two of Australia’s big four banks, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), began the process of repaying thousands of staff who had been underpaid as a result of systems errors at both institutions.

Westpac announced in July 2020 that it would pay back A$8 million (US$5.7 million) to around 8,000 employees. Westpac said that it did not apply the correct methodology for determining long-service leave entitlements where staff had changed their working arrangements, such as moving from part-time to full-time. Westpac also said that, for long-service leave entitlements, different rules applied to different employees based on their employment history and working arrangements. As a result of the error, some Westpac staff were overpaid, but these employees would not be asked to repay any money.

CBA announced in April 2019 that it expected to pay A$15 million to current and former employees. CBA reportedly underpaid its staff and that of its Bankwest subsidiary due to errors in its systems, including payroll and other human resources systems. This also resulted in problems calculating leave, superannuation and redundancy entitlements. Some of the problems reportedly dated back 10 years.

In December 2019, it was reported that CBA had widened the investigation into the issues, examining the records of 250,000 current and former staff, going back as far as 2002. The average reimbursement was reportedly about A$220 per employee. Due to the wider investigation, CBA was reportedly expected to pay A$53.1 million in repayments to employees.

### In focus: Collateral mismanagement

Over the last few years, risk managers have [increasingly placed](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7450731/top-10-operational-risks-for-2020) risks such as cyber, information security and third-party at the top of their [rankings](https://www.risk.net/comment/7422011/op-risk-data-citi-fined-18m-for-failing-to-buy-flood-insurance#infocus) for current and emerging risks. But even as new threats emerge, traditional operational risks remain – and many reared their head again during Covid-enforced lockdown. Perhaps the costliest was trade and commodity finance fraud based on fraudulently documented or fictitious collateral.

Perhaps the most high-profile example was the $3.8 billion default of Singaporean oil trader [Hin Leong](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2020/no-serious-impact-on-oil-trading-and-bunkering-sectors-banking-system-remains-sound), on the back of [plummeting oil prices](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7532031/cme-was-ill-prepared-for-negative-oil-prices-fcms-say) in April. Debts running to billions of dollars to a group of lenders including ABN Amro, HSBC and Societe Generale were reportedly backed by assets that turned out to be either pledged multiple times over or non-existent, according to press reports, making it unclear how much lenders will be able to recoup.

There are plenty of similar stories among Asia-Pacific lenders in the commodities sector. For example, in June 2020, 14 Chinese financial institutions were reported to have lost a total of 18.4 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) after a gold processor, Wuhan-based Kingold Jewelry, used fake gold bars as collateral on the loans.

But the trail runs much deeper. Since 2012, ORX News has recorded 120 stories in its database that have been tagged with the collateral management process. These stories mostly involve lenders losing millions of dollars on loans that were backed by fraudulent or understated collateral.

Stories based around collateral management and fraud tend to have a low frequency but a high severity, with total losses often in the hundreds of millions or even billions. Often, these events cause losses at several firms.

In the example of Kingold, it was not until after the company had begun defaulting on its loans that the lenders tested the gold bars, and found that they were made of a gilded copper alloy.

In another example, Natixis was defrauded of $31.8 million in 2017 after a company used fake receipts for nickel stored in warehouses as collateral for the loan, but only found out that the receipts were fraudulent many months after the loan had been issued.

Due diligence is the first step to preventing such losses. Collateral management agreements (CMAs) are becoming an important risk mitigant, especially in the days of Basel III regulations. In this model, a collateral manager will take control of the physical commodity until the trade is completed and the loan paid off in full.

CMAs alone are not enough, however. Instead, banks and lenders need to better understand the processes involved in collateral management, say op risk practitioners. Lenders and other financial institutions are routinely said to be over-reliant on promissory notes and the like when determining the value of collateral used against loans, rather than on the physical processes of verifying and confirming collateral.
