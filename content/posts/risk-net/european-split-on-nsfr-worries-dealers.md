Conflicting proposals on the calibration of the net stable funding ratio unveiled by European Union policymakers have raised concerns that European banks will be forced to raise a far greater amount of high-quality funding for derivatives positions than foreign dealers.

Last week, the European council presidency issued [a progress report](http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14896-2017-REV-1/en/pdf) on the revised Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR II), which will graft Basel III banking reforms – including the NSFR – into European law. It states that the stable funding requirement for derivative liabilities should be set at 5% of their gross notional amount.

This runs counter to the [European parliament’s own report](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=COMPARL&reference=PE-613.409&format=PDF&language=EN&secondRef=02) on the regulation, dated November 22, which favours a 15% factor. The council argues the 5% is “sufficiently conservative”, whereas the parliament claims this is “generally regarded as inadequate”.

Banks have welcomed the council’s proposal, which matches the internationally agreed 5% floor made by the Basel Committee, and warned that the parliament’s approach will create an uneven playing field.

“We are pushing for the 5%. We have met with Isda and our supervisors across the globe and many of them are supporting the 5%, but in Europe, we see some member states still want an alignment with the 20%,” says a regulatory change director at a large European bank.

Industry sources say the parliament’s recommendation would place European banks at a disadvantage if other jurisdictions – such as the US, Japan and Hong Kong – adopt a 5% stable funding requirement for derivatives liabilities.

Trade groups say there is some resistance to the 5% floor within the council too, meaning this progress report may not be indicative of its final decision. “Some authorities and member states might still be reflecting on the Basel decision, but we expect in the end that is what will be supported in the council,” says Stefano Mazzocchi, managing director for advocacy at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe. “If 5% is the final outcome, that would address the key concerns, particularly if combined with an appropriate observation period, to make sure disproportionate burdens for end-users and for banks are avoided,” he adds.

The NSFR requires banks to hold a minimum amount of high-quality funding appropriate to their assets and off-balance sheet activities. The ratio is calculated by dividing a bank’s available stable funding, which applies to its liabilities, by its required stable funding, which applies to its assets. A dealer must hold total ASF at least equal to its total RSF at all times.

Basel’s treatment of derivatives under the ratio [has long frustrated the industry.](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2462270/funding-flap-dealers-slam-nsfr-impact-derivatives) The committee’s initial calibration slapped an RSF amount on derivatives liabilities of 20%. Yet, [in October](https://www.bis.org/press/p171006.htm), the standard-setter said national regulators would have the discretion to lower the value of this factor to a floor of 5%. This has prompted [allegations in the US](https://www.risk.net/regulation/basel-committee/5361766/basel-concession-strengthens-us-opposition-to-nsfr) that the entire calibration process is arbitrary.

The Basel amendment opens the door for national authorities to take a wide variety of approaches. “It is not usual that the Basel committee introduces such national discretion,” says the regulatory change director. “At the end of the day, it could introduce level-playing-field issues. This is what we see in Europe with the 5% proposed by the council and the 15% by the parliament.”

The council has kept its options open by recommending a review clause be added to CRR II in case the standard is reviewed at the international level. The Basel Committee said in October it is “considering” whether a revision to the derivatives factor is warranted.

Thomas Decouvelaere, head of pricing for fixed income at Societe Generale, says the review clause introduces “a source of uncertainty”, but insists the council’s report is still “better news for banks than the parliament opinion”.

As the derivatives RSF is calculated as a simple percentage of gross-margined liabilities, dealers are keen for policymakers to agree on the Basel-defined floor.

“The [council’s] communication is welcome for two reasons. Firstly it provides certainty around the number itself and, secondly, it appears to encourage consistency across different regulatory regimes,” says Ian Harris, head of credit value adjustment trading at Credit Suisse in London. “Clearly, it benefits the industry for the number to come in at the lower end of the range for what is potentially one of the more volatile and challenging measures contained within the NSFR.”

### Key actors

Market participants say EU policymakers representing Germany and Spain are among the key actors pushing for a higher derivatives RSF amount, with UK and French representatives opposed.

“In Europe there are always two camps – member states that are pushing for more proportionality for smaller banks and something more punitive for large banks, and member states that have large banks that are on the opposite side,” says the regulatory change director.

Though the parliament is taking a punitive approach to derivatives RSF, dealers could draw comfort from another aspect of its report – a proposed amendment to CRR II that would permit repo trades be calculated on a net basis provided they share “the same explicit final settlement date”. In practice this could allow dealers to net down matched repo books and qualify for a 0% funding requirement under the NSFR.

However, much hinges on how strictly the “final settlement date” provision is interpreted. If offsetting trades can only be netted if they share identical maturities, the overall benefit would be minimal.

The European council, parliament and commission will seek to reconcile their versions of CRR II in a series of trialogue negotiations next year. These are expected to take place in the second half of 2018, under the Austrian presidency of the council.
