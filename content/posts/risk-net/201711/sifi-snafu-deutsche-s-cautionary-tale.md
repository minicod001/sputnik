{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Subjecting big firms to tougher regulation is sensible in principle but difficult in practice_{{< /quote >}}

June of 2016 was not a happy time for Deutsche Bank. A week after the Brexit vote had sent its share price tumbling – and the day after its US unit failed the Federal Reserve’s annual stress test for the second year running – the International Monetary Fund published a report labelling it the “most important net contributor to systemic risks” among the world’s largest banks.

The press jumped on it: “Deutsche Bank hit by IMF hazard warning” said the Financial Times. The Wall Street Journal headline described Deutsche as the “greatest risk” to global finance. And the label stuck. A month later, with Deutsche stock struggling, CNN reported “The world’s riskiest bank is in trouble”.

From the start of June to the end of July, the bank’s stock fell almost 25%.

So it’s probably of scant comfort to Deutsche that, 18 months later, one of the economists behind the methodology the IMF drew on now tells Risk he believes the fund [incorrectly applied](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5351741/imf-wrong-to-label-deutsche-worlds-riskiest-bank-says-economist) his research – something the IMF disputes.

What might seem like an academic squabble has a strong bearing on one of the central pillars of post-crisis reforms: if the biggest firms are to be singled out and subjected to more punitive regulation, what criteria should policymakers and regulators use when [choosing them](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5346801/fishing-for-sifis-row-over-nobel-laureates-risk-model)? So far, official approaches are deliberately crude, while academics have cooked up more sophisticated, dynamic models – some of the latter are highly influential in policymaking circles, and all of them have flaws.

While researchers look for a winning measure, the official framework for regulating the largest insurers – dubbed global systemically important insurers – is fast unravelling. In early October, Risk revealed US representatives at the Financial Stability Board were [blocking](https://www.risk.net/asset-management/insurance/5342871/us-blocking-new-list-of-global-too-big-to-fail-insurers) efforts to update the G-Sii list. On October 30, a US Treasury [report](https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/A-Financial-System-That-Creates-Economic-Opportunities-Asset_Management-Insurance.pdf) argued entity-based evaluations of risk were typically not the right basis on which to regulate the sector. It now appears the FSB is minded to side with the Treasury’s view, and fundamentally reappraise its approach to supervising G-Siis – to the [annoyance](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5357381/no-plans-to-scrap-systemic-insurer-rules-says-iais-chair) of insurance supervisors.

This week, Senate Republicans reached a tentative deal on a bill which would exempt banks with an asset base of less than $250 billion from systemically-important financial institution status, up from the current threshold of $50 billion – enough to knock at least a dozen names off the US’s domestic Sifi list. Lobbyists have vowed to continue a push for activities-based assessment of banks, instead of a crude asset threshold.

Where does this leave the basic idea that big firms should face tougher regulation? Arguably, right where you’d expect: it’s a sensible principle that is proving incredibly difficult to put into practice.
