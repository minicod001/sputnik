The US Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to formulate new rules to govern electronic trading in fixed-income markets.

“We are looking at the fixed-income market with a bigger focus than you’ve seen in the past,” SEC chairman Jay Clayton said at a hedge fund conference in New York on November 28.

The SEC has [established](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-209) a Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee to identify areas for regulatory improvements in the corporate and municipal bond markets. The committee will provide input for the agency’s rulemaking on algorithmic trading in the fixed-income markets.

“We have set up the advisory committee to look at developments in the bond markets as we move towards algo trading,” Clayton said. “What we want to do is get that regulation right as technology comes in.”

Electronic trading accounts for less than 20% of US corporate bond volumes, but that share is growing with the introduction of [new execution venues](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2401714/dark-pools-and-platforms-vie-fix-credit-markets) and protocols. MarketAxess saw electronic volumes grow by more than 15% in the first half of 2017, while rival Tradeweb recorded a jump of 60% over the same period. Trumid, an electronic tradingvenue launched in 2014, saw over $10 billion of bonds traded on its platform in the 12 months to July 2017.

Clayton said he expected those trends to continue. “Some of the developments seen in the equity markets… are going to come to the fixed-income markets. We also recognise those markets are not the same. What we should not be doing is saying, ‘Hey, this worked in the equity markets and so it must work in fixed-income markets’.”

Clayton confirmed the SEC would press ahead with new rules on [derivatives usage](https://www.risk.net/asset-management/2442503/blunt-sec-derivatives-proposals-too-onerous-funds) and liquidity risk management for asset managers, which were proposed before he was appointed to lead the agency. However, he said implementing [curbs](https://www.risk.net/asset-management/2442503/blunt-sec-derivatives-proposals-too-onerous-funds) on the use of leverage was “not at the front of my agenda”.

The SEC chairman also sought to temper expectations of major regulatory rollbacks following the publication on October 26 of a 176-page [report](https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/Joint_Staff_Report_Treasury_10-15-2014.pdf) by the US Department of the Treasury on regulation of the asset management and insurance industries. The [report](https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/Joint_Staff_Report_Treasury_10-15-2014.pdf), produced in response to an executive order from US president Donald Trump, rejected the notion that asset managers should be treated as systemically risky and subject to stress testing, and recommended that the SEC [adopt](https://www.risk.net/asset-management/5354201/softened-liquidity-rule-would-still-be-misguided-us-asset-managers) a more principles-based approach to liquidity risk management.

“There are very few recommendations in the reports that I don’t think are reasonable,” Clayton said. “Do I agree with all of them? No. Are we going to get to all of them? No.”
