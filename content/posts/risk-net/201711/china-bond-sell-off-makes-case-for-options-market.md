China’s recent bond market sell-off, which sent sovereign yields to a three-year high in November, could pressure the world’s second-largest economy to develop an interest rate options market, allowing investors to hedge their exposure, according to market participants.

With existing interest rate swaps exposing bond investors to basis risk, the creation of an options market would allow participants to express two-way views on the direction of yields more easily, thereby reducing the risk of market overshoots in either direction and making it simpler to hedge market moves.

“We are at a critical juncture, and this is a golden opportunity to try and change the fundamentals of how the market works,” says the head of markets for China at one global bank. “The Chinese market has come to the point where, unless you diversify the investor base, you will be fuelling further one-way positions. Doing futures only adds to this one-way trend – options will cap the volatility.”

Climbing inflation, Beijing’s deleveraging campaign to force the financial sector to curb its debt levels and concerns the central bank might embark on a new wave of monetary tightening triggered a flight to safety, with asset managers selling equities and bonds to boost cash levels. This pushed benchmark 10-year bond yields up from 3.7% on October 24 to just over 4% by November 23 – the highest since October 2014. Yields have since dipped below the 4% mark, but remain high.

However, the People’s Bank of China has been increasingly active in using its reverse repo facility to avoid liquidity squeezes in the interbank market. As a result, the seven-day interbank repo rate, which markets use to price interest rate swaps, remained at 3.44%, despite the rise in bond yields.

“The IRS is not moving higher as expected because the PBoC is trying to keep liquidity stable, so that’s why [we] see the continued cash-bond selling, but the IRS is not [affected],” says a head of markets at an Asian bank.

This negated the effectiveness of any IRS-based bond hedges that had been put in place, according to market participants.

“In normal market conditions, one would expect the IRS to track the speed of the cash-bond sell-off, with the spread remaining within a certain range, but this did not happen here,” says one head of local markets strategy at a global bank. “Therefore, any interest rate swaps that were used to hedge cash-bond positions didn’t work properly and investors got hurt.”

He says the spread between the IRS repo rate and the bond yield is typically between 20 and 30 basis points, but it was more than double that during the bond sell-off.

By contrast, the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate did track the rise in bond yields. But David Qu, a Shanghai-based economist at Australian bank ANZ, says this is rarely used as the benchmark for interest rate hedging. “The repo IRS market is much more liquid than Shibor IRS, so if you want to do a large-volume trade you need to do it via the repo IRS,” he says.

The need for more hedging instruments is all the more important now that China is opening up its bond markets. In 2016, the launch of the China Interbank Bond Market (CIBM) created a new route for foreign players to access the onshore debt markets. Things have been made even easier with the launch of Bond Connect, allowing them to tap into this market without first having an onshore presence.

For now, [only domestic non-bank investors](https://www.risk.net/regulation/2470282/volatility-fears-obstruct-china-treasury-futures-growth) such as securities houses and mutual funds can trade interest rate swaps and plain bond futures. A trading scandal in the 1990s means domestic banks are still not allowed to trade bond futures. A similar exclusion exists for foreign players, although the PBoC issued a statement on November 10, saying overseas institutional investors would now be able to participate in forward rate agreements and interest rate swaps.

The head of markets at the global bank argues the opening up of the bond market makes it all the more important to develop the right hedging tools: “We have a situation where, for years, China has been developing and expanding the bond market, but the participants have stayed the same. If you don’t expand the nature of the participants and the nature of the products, the market is at risk of a one-way dive, which is what we have now seen. When you have a bull market no-one cares. Now you have a bear market everybody gets hurt.”

### Need for diversification

A lack of the right type of investor is also a challenge for the growth of the interest rate options market. Qu from ANZ says it is important to make sure any new money coming into the market is part of a long-term investment and unlikely to jump straight out again, making the situation worse. Recently, speculative funds with high leverage have been coming to the market, which Qu says helped contribute to the sell-off.

Even if the authorities do choose to launch an interest rate options market – and they have so far not given any indication this is on the cards – it is unlikely to attract the current crop of Chinese bond investors. The overwhelming majority of investors in the country’s bond markets are domestic financial institutions, which tend to hold the assets to maturity and are not yet familiar with the options world.

Foreign players could be eager users of options, but their participation in the bond market currently remains moot – just 1.6% of total market share, according to Bloomberg estimates. Those who invest through Bond Connect pick short-term, negotiable certificates of deposit. The attractive yield on these products helps offset any currency risk that investors might face.

Three years ago, when the renminbi was reliably appreciating, foreign players could have happily invested in the Chinese bond market and enjoyed a positive carry. But in 2014, Beijing widened the band within which the currency is allowed to fluctuate, pushing up the cost of hedging and deterring many from entering the market.

“With the inclusion of the renminbi in the Special Drawing Rights [International Monetary Fund basket of currencies], we have seen many offshore investors interested in the Chinese bond market,” says Ryan Chan, co-head of business development for the cross-structuring group in Asia for Société Générale. “But the negative cost of carry means some investors are being pushed away because they cannot hedge out the renminbi exposure totally.”
