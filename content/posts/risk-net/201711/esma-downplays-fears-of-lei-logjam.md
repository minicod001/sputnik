A senior European regulator has defended the mechanism by which counterparties caught by new trading rules next year must register for a formal [legal entity identifier](https://www.risk.net/topics/legal-entity-identifiers-%28LEIs%29), arguing that criticisms of the process as costly and overly bureaucratic are wide of the mark.

Any entity in scope of Europe’s revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ([Mifid II](https://www.risk.net/topics/mifid-ii)) and its accompanying regulation, which comes into force on January 3, will be forbidden to trade with a counterparty that does not have an LEI, whether it is based inside or outside the European Economic Area. While the process of obtaining an LEI is theoretically fairly simple, banks have repeatedly raised fears of delays and backlogs if non-European counterparties leave applications until the last minute.

Speaking at the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association annual conference in Hong Kong on November 30, however, Verena Ross, executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, said fears of widespread delays had yet to become a reality, and that processing times from most entities licensed to offer LEIs remained swift.

“Many have voiced concerns about the rigorous implementation of LEIs in the European Union and complained about the difficulty in getting an LEI, and I want to counter some of the myths around this topic. In effect, it is just a matter of a few days to get assigned an LEI at an average cost of about €100. The LEI should be seen as a global success story, and constitutes an example of where we have genuinely achieved a common global data standard,” she says.

The LEI is a 20-digit alphanumerical code based on the ISO 17442 standard, developed by the International Organization for Standardization. The code enables clear and unique identification of legal entities participating in transactions, and is needed for firms to fulfil their regulatory reporting obligations under Mifid II.

Esma has made clear that a rule of ‘[no LEI, no trade’](https://www.risk.net/regulation/mifid/5321641/day-of-the-mifids-what-happens-on-january-3) will apply from January 3. In Asia, [counterparties have been warned](https://www.risk.net/regulation/mifid/5324226/asia-warned-of-lei-crunch-over-mifid-ii-deadline) they face mass trade rejections if they fail to get an LEI.

Several LEI operating units (LOUs) – entities licensed to offer LEIs – tell Risk.net there has been a recent upsurge in issuances ahead of January 3 but that, proportionally, firms in Asia-Pacific appear to be lagging behind.

Matthew Chan, head of product and strategy, product services, Asia-Pacific for the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, says more than 797,000 LEIs have been issued as of November 30, citing data from the Global LEI Foundation. About 40% of the total was issued by DTCC’s own Global Markets Entity Identifier utility.

According to Chan, it is hard to work out how many LEIs will ultimately be required, with estimates ranging between 1.5 million and three million.

“We think there are still a lot of firms in Asia that have yet to apply for LEIs. If you look at the overall figure, around 4% of issued LEIs come from Apac, which suggests Asia is underweight and probably isn’t quite there in terms of the progress that it needs to make. Bear in mind there’s only 33 days left,” he explains. “Anecdotally, I think there may be firms that are not fully aware of if and where they need to have an LEI in place. That being said, if firms are acting now to confirm what they need to have in place, as they seem to be, there is still time to have LEIs issued in time for the Mifid II implementation.”

Still, applications appear to be rising: the 797,000 figure represents a 50% increase from September, when only 530,000 LEIs have been issued.

“For the whole year of last year, there were only 40,000 LEIs issued globally. So you can see how things are ramping up very quickly. From an issuance perspective, even though we know all the LOUs are staffing up, as are we, turnaround will depend on how much volume is coming through,” says Chan.

A Hong Kong-based senior executive working for the LEI team at another LOU says her organisation currently issues LEIs at a rate of 12,000 a day: “Our turnaround time is typically less than three days, but there may be a capacity crunch as we get closer to the Mifid II date. We are gearing up our resources to handle the expected increase in requests in December,” she says.

Ross also commended several Asian regulators for mandating the use of LEIs in the activity of over-the-counter derivatives trading.

“We’re happy to see that the use of the LEIs is required or is in the process of being implemented by regulators such as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Securities and Futures Commission and also by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and other regulators in this region,” she said.

“This should encourage us to move ahead with the specification and global agreement around other key data standards, such as the overnight unique product identifier.”
