Russia is preparing to issue a government-backed crypto-currency, [CryptoRuble](http://www.aif.ru/money/economy/rossiya_vypustit_sobstvennuyu_kriptovalyutu_ministr_svyazi). Unlike decentralised crypto-currencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum, there is no mining involved in [CryptoRuble](http://www.aif.ru/money/economy/rossiya_vypustit_sobstvennuyu_kriptovalyutu_ministr_svyazi) – all transactions are recorded via blockchain and verified by a centralised government authority.

The implications are worrying: such a system could be a means for a state to exert control or evade controls – including sanctions. Run badly, it could also become a haven for dirty money.

Decentralised crypto-currencies have flourished since the inception of bitcoin in 2009, with total market capitalisation exceeding $170 billion as of October 17, 2017. Anonymity of transactions and decentralisation is appealing to a range of users – including those with nefarious intentions, such as money laundering and tax evasion – but, unsurprisingly, not to central banks or sovereign governments.

Blockchain is not synonymous with decentralisation, being a ledger for keeping a record of all transactions. Like traditional bank ledgers, it can help prevent or reduce fraud, errors, and so on. But this benefit is only the tip of the iceberg. With decentralised crypto-currencies, one of the key concerns of central banks and sovereign governments is ceding control. With government-issued crypto-currencies, central banks and sovereign governments will gain even more control, not less, than with the current banking system.

Blockchain maintained by a centralised government authority provides a centralised, un-fragmented ledger of all transactions and associated information, such as meta-data – a tempting prospect for any government.

Added to this, ‘undocumented’ CryptoRubles – those without proof of origin – will reportedly be subject to a 13% tax. This is, whether intentionally or not, effectively a government-sponsored money-laundering machine, and with such a low overhead should be extremely attractive to all sorts of shady players. Russia will attract not only Russian but also foreign money (including dirty money).

It seems likely CryptoRubles will act as a tax shelter for US and other foreign individuals. One embedded bonus for the Russian government is that it will own the information encoded in blockchain, including potentially shady transactions, giving it unprecedented insight and potential leverage over the transactors.

However, for Russia – or another state at odds with the West – the primary goal of issuing a government crypto-currency is to free their monetary system from the controls exerted by the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank (ECB) and their allied central banks.

CryptoRubles create a buffer layer that only the Russian government has control over, with pertinent information inaccessible to foreign nations. Russian elites can launder their money using CryptoRuble, become impervious to (or less affected by) economic sanctions, make their assets currently tied up by US and EU sanctions more liquid, and so on.

For instance, consider an oligarch targeted by sanctions. With the advent of CryptoRuble, this oligarch could set up a new shell company (for example via a convoluted web of trusts) to continue a prior line of business such as exports of Russian oil or some other commodity. Revenues of this shell company can be legally converted into CryptoRubles. These CryptoRubles can then be converted into funds, or property, goods/services, etc, accessible by the oligarch.

Since CryptoRuble uses a centralised blockchain as a non-distributed ledger only available to the Russian government, its conversion into the funds accessible by the oligarch remains hidden from all other observers. The Russian government may tax these funds at 13% if the oligarch does not disclose their origin, but this is a small price to pay. Thus, CryptoRuble will allow various individuals and companies to skirt sanctions. [North Korea is already suspected of using bitcoin](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/sep/25/north-korea-bitcoin-use-suspected-to-skirt-sanctio/) for precisely this purpose.

### Disruption

CryptoRuble will disrupt the current world monetary system, the Fed, ECB, US and EU policies, their law enforcement operations and many other areas. Drug money will be easier to clean. Anti-money laundering (AML) controls and efforts will be adversely affected – with the anticipated 13% haircut, this opportunity is simply too attractive to those with nefarious intents, and will undoubtedly give an incentive to shady players. Money will flow away from the US, EU and UK and into Russia.

Other countries will probably issue their own crypto-currencies, and multiple government-issued crypto-currencies (see table A) will only exacerbate the deterioration of AML controls. Other Brics members (Brazil, China, India and South Africa) are natural candidates, and China, Dubai, Estonia and Kazakhstan are reportedly considering following Russia’s lead.

A key difference between government-issued and decentralised crypto-currencies is that the former do not require mining – the energetically and computationally costly process of verifying transactions, which is rewarded with small payments in newly minted crypto-currency. In this sense, centralised government-issued crypto-currencies are more “efficient”, and should be cheaper to maintain and more readily usable as legal tender in large economies such as Russia.

This disruptive technology – crypto-currencies – will indeed end up disrupting the status quo. However, at least in the mid-term, forward-thinking sovereign states that embrace and adapt it to their advantage will end up being the disruptors as opposed to disrupted. The US is the sovereign state with most to lose in this process, with a clear policy implication: adapt to the changing reality, issue CryptoDollar now, or risk being marginalised.

### Stakeholder implications

What about other stakeholders? In the table below, we outline some pros and cons of government-issued crypto-currencies for various interested parties. For example, the populace benefits from lower transaction costs, but the price to pay is diminished privacy and a greater control by the government.

Table A: Potential pros and cons of government-issued cryptocurrencies

As another example, consider banks and other traditional financial institutions. Government-issued crypto-currencies will diminish some functions of banks since the traditional local-by-nature bank ledgers will become obsolete – as will paper money, with implications for ATMs and the bank fees associated with them.

Generally, transaction costs will be reduced, which is bad news for banks. However, this does not make banks obsolete, as they have a number of other functions, such as provision of credit.

CryptoRuble will have implications for existing decentralised crypto-currencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum. In the short term, higher volatility for decentralised crypto-currencies can be expected due to two competing perceptions: i) government-issued crypto-currencies go against the premise that decentralisation is key to crypto-currencies; and ii) on the other hand, they lend increased credibility to blockchain technology.

In the beginning, there is likely to be a lot of noise and uncertainty, political jostling, security concerns, fear-mongering in press coverage, etc. However, it is feasible that in the longer term, decentralised crypto-currencies will benefit from increased credibility, and even more users will jump on the bandwagon – both those motivated by a major world power issuing its own crypto-currency as well as those perceiving this as sovereign governments attempting to exert more control. Interesting times lie ahead.

At first glance, it might seem unexpected that Russia, of all countries, has emerged as a leader in this process. However, the reason is not technological but geopolitical. Russia has been subject to sanctions and global pressure due to its foreign policy. Dependence on the existing world monetary order is a major stumbling block for the country. Its desire to gain a greater degree of independence from the Fed/ECB is by no means a surprise.

Crypto-currencies provide a simple solution for Russia – if anything, it is surprising that it took it so long.

It appears that government-issued crypto-currencies are a foregone conclusion. Large sovereign states have the technological know-how and means to do this. What about small and/or developing countries? If they are forced to outsource issuance of their government-backed crypto-currencies to larger states, geopolitical and economic implications are evident: less sovereignty and ceding control over crucial information to more powerful countries.

Alternatively, some countries could partner with the private sector, as appears to be the case with Dubai, but this would raise its own host of issues.
