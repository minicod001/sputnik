{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Expectations rise of forbearance after Council of the EU proposes buy side VM exemption_{{< /quote >}}

Proposals published by the Council of the EU earlier this week are fuelling expectations that buy-side firms will not have to post variation margin on certain foreign exchange forwards from next year – a controversial quirk of Europe’s rules. The proposals would limit margining to interdealer trades only.

“I’m fairly confident I will not need to be margining with funds from January 3. I think that is where we are headed,” says a regulatory expert at one European bank. “If you had asked me two weeks ago I would have said margining would be required. But as things have developed recently I am confident that will no longer be the case.”

Uniquely among big derivatives jurisdictions, the EU’s margining rules for non-cleared derivatives require financial counterparties in the EU [to post variation margin](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5313881/fx-forwards-users-drop-eu-banks-over-margin-rule) against physically settled currency forwards, with implementation due from January 3, 2018. For many firms, this would be the first time they had margined derivatives contracts, imposing brand new costs and operational burdens.

However, a compromise proposal from the Council of the EU to amend the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir), published on November 15, includes a paragraph exempting all firms from posting initial margin on physically settled forex forwards, and limiting variation margin to interdealer trades.

The proposals follow intense lobbying by the industry to European regulators, according to the European bank’s regulatory expert.

“There are discussions going on under the Emir Refit with the European Banking Association, Esma and the EC, and it’s all [been] falling into place within the last 24–48 hours,” he says.

The proposal states: “Physically settled foreign exchanged forwards shall not be subject to initial margins exchanges and shall only be subject to exchange of variation margins for transactions concluded between credit institutions authorised in accordance with Directive 2006/48/EC.”

The document also mentions the move in the preamble text: “The need for international convergence and for non-financial and small financial counterparties to reduce the risks associated with their currency risk exposures make it necessary to set out special risk management procedures for physically settled foreign exchanged forwards,” it says.

“In view of their specific risk profile it is appropriate to restrict the mandatory exchange of variation margins on physically settled forex forwards to transactions between the most systemic counterparties in order to limit the build-up of systemic risk,” it adds.

The changes are part of an official review of Emir, released by the European Commission in May. The Council of the EU and European Parliament are developing their own versions of an amended Emir, which need to be approved by member states and then reconciled in the trialogue phase before being officially implemented.

“A high level of harmonisation across jurisdictions in the forex market is key to ensuring a well-functioning global market. We are therefore focusing on this recent Emir refit text on the variation margin issue and look forward to engaging the relevant authorities as this develops,” says James Kemp, managing director of the global forex division of the Global Financial Markets Association.

“The proposed revisions to the Emir margin rules are a strong step towards the cross-border harmonization of the margin rules. Deliverable forex forwards are exempted from margin under every regulatory regime except for Europe, and these proposed revisions allow for a more consistent cross-border application of the margin rules. If the proposed changes are adopted, our buy side clients will be very happy with this outcome,” adds Chris Bender, director of regulatory advisory at Chatham Financial.

The regulatory expert at one European bank says that as the amendments are unlikely to become law before the start date, banks are set to lobby national competent authorities to give forbearance when the rules kick in on January 3.

“I think they are unlikely to change the regulation before January. So therefore everybody would need to speak to the local regulator and say ‘Listen, the regulation says this, are you happy that I don’t do this?’,” he says.

Two banks that spoke with Risk.net said they had yet to speak with the UK Prudential Regulatory Authority about the issue. The PRA declined to comment. The European Securities and Markets Authority did not respond to a request for comment before this article went to press.

One forex structuring head at a large dealer says he is hopeful regulators would apply forbearance. “The expectation is that this may result in some determination by the local regulators to delay or otherwise not apply variation margin to forex forwards,” he notes.

National regulators gave forbearance to the industry from having to comply with variation margin requirements on other non-cleared instruments from March 1 [following guidance](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/3936751/regulators-relent-ahead-of-vm-big-bang) from the European Supervisory Authorities in February, due to the [slow rate](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/3936751/regulators-relent-ahead-of-vm-big-bang)of documentation repapering in the lead-up to the deadline.

In Europe, both swaps and forwards were initially meant to be margined from March 1, but an amendment on July 28 to the European Commission’s regulatory technical standards detailing the margin requirements clarified the start date for forwards as being the application of the relevant delegated act in the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or December 31, 2018, whichever is sooner. With the directive being applied from January 3, 2018, this is the date from which forwards need to be margined.

Documentation teams at the major dealers have been scrambling to get collateral paperwork in place with forex forwards users ahead of the deadline.

“Everyone and their mother in the documentation departments are repapering all their contracts, which they had carved forex out of, and putting them back in,” says the forex structuring head.

He says a delay or cancellation of the variation margin requirement “would be fantastic”.

A managing director for one large dealer’s markets business however points out that while the proposal puts the variation margin requirement for forex forwards only on “credit institutions” defined under the Capital Requirements Regulation, this can also include some non-banks.
