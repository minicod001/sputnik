The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is looking to simplify and lower its fee structure, to encourage more firms to voluntarily clear US Treasuries.

“We want to look at reducing the complexity of the model,” said Jim Hraska, general manager of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), a subsidiary of the DTCC and the sole central counterparty (CCP) for US Treasuries. “We will be putting forth some changes in the very near future which will break down some of these elements.”

Hraska hinted the DTCC may ditch per-ticket transaction fees in favour of a notional-based charge. “First, we will be looking at the transaction element and charge something that is reasonable, and we think it’s important to take a new approach and look at that on a notional basis,” he said. “We’re going to look at both the intraday positions and the risks that could come into the CCP, as well as looking at end of positions, and rebalance that appropriately to encourage folks to come into the CCP.”

The FICC currently charges separate fees for matching and netting trades in addition to a per-ticket fee based on volume. Taken together, those charges can add up to as much as 60 cents per trade. High-frequency trading (HFT) firms, many of which execute tens of thousands of trades a day, have cited the FICC’s fee model as a [barrier](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2457784/dtcc-coaxing-hfts-become-clearing-members) to joining the clearing house.

“It’s been suggested that the pricing model or architecture could use some revision and a fresh set of eyes, so we have spent over a year now looking at our pricing model,” said Hraska. “Our services do have a cost to them, so we can’t just say we’re going to make it 30% cheaper, but we are looking at a few things.”

Hraska was speaking on a panel at a conference on US Treasury market structure at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on November 28.

Earlier in the day, Craig Phillips, counselor to the Secretary of the US Department of the Treasury, presented the first batch of US Treasury trade data reported to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (Trace), which revealed that only around a quarter of US Treasury transactions are centrally cleared.

Others on the conference panel, which consisted of members of the New York Fed’s Treasury market practices group, stressed they wanted to see that figure rise. “Eyeballing the Trace data, what we’re seeing is that central clearing only covers 25% of the market,” said Ryan Sheftel, global head of fixed income at GTS, a non-bank market-maker. “Futures and swaps markets have the answer key – central clearing for all participants. Clearly, the world has decided that is better for markets as a whole, so how do we get from where we are today to where swaps is, which is 84% of the market cleared?”

Some industry figures have previously [called](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/2460946/tradeweb-us-treasuries-clearing-should-be-mandatory)for a clearing mandate similar to the one for interest rate swaps to move the US Treasury market in that direction.

Sheftel argued that shifting more transactions into clearing would reduce systemic risk. “Once you don’t have a CCP in the middle, you’re either exposing yourself to Lehman-style default risk or operational risk,” he said. “The answer is simple, but not easy – there should be central clearing on a non-discriminatory and economically efficient basis for all market participants.”

Stuart Wexler, general counsel at Nex Group, echoed that sentiment. “We also support getting more participation in clearing, with the key phrase being on [good] economic terms,” he said. “One of the issues is always going to be the HFTs, and the fact they’re flat at the end of the day and are relatively small, so what do they actually add to a clearing house? But it seems to work in futures.”

Nex Group operates BrokerTec, the largest interdealer US Treasury trading venue, with a market share of around 80%. HFTs account for the [bulk](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/interest-rate-derivatives/2426923/client-list-reveals-hft-dominance-brokertec) of trading activity on the platform, which assumes the credit risk of firms do not clear at FICC.

This is a risk BrokerTec would rather not bear. “We’re an electronic matching platform. We really don’t want to be in the business of credit enhancement, but we end up being there because of this oddity in the marketplace. We do it well, we take it seriously, and we spend a lot of resources on it, but we’re really not the best-placed part of the ecosystem to do that,” said Wexler.

The effort to cut fees comes on the heels of the DTCC’s proposal to implement a $74 billion liquidity facility at the FICC, which was [approved](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5358746/sec-approves-dtccs-74bn-liquidity-facility) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission on November 15. The move had been [criticised](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5292066/dtccs-74-billion-liquidity-charge-riles-members) by smaller FICC members, which claim it will impose excessive costs on them.
