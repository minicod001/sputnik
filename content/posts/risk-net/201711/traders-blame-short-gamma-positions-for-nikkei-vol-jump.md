{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Uridashis, macro positioning and ETFs behind record 23% rise in volatility on November 9_{{< /quote >}}

Short gamma positioning from structured products, macro flows and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is being blamed for a sharp intraday Nikkei move earlier this month that saw the related volatility index jump a record 23%.

Traders, however, say a repeat is unlikely, as the Bank of Japan still has about $11 billion of capacity to support the market, and dealers are unlikely to leave their positions as exposed.

On November 9, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average broke the 23,000 level for the first time since January 1992, as financial and securities shares rallied. It surged to a morning high of 23,382.15, before falling to an afternoon session low of 22,523 points.  The index was at 22,523 on November 22.

The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index hit 24.22 on November 9, its highest level since April. It ended the day at 21.25 marking a 23% surge from the previous day – the largest ever on an open-to-close movement in the index of less than 1%.

Richard Byworth, head of multi-strategy sales for Asia-Pacific at Nomura, says a combination of Nikkei-linked autocallable structured products hedging, real money positioning and ETF trading put market-makers into short gamma positions, where traders need to sell as the spot price falls, exacerbating the move.

“All of these factors playing out in tandem left little opportunity for desks to cover their short gamma," says Byworth.

“While there are a number of reasons being given for last week’s violent move in Nikkei, short gamma positioning was no doubt responsible for the magnitude of the move.”

A November 15 note from Bank of America Merrill Lynch also pointed the finger at short gamma: “The fragility event occurred as crowded short gamma positions unwound at the same time on November 9,” said the note.

Gamma is used to measure the rate of change in an option's delta as the underlying security moves. If a bank is short gamma in equities, a fall in the share equivalent position or delta moves that position longer, requiring the trader to sell shares to re-hedge. This means that as the price falls, traders are forced to continually sell, potentially exacerbating a move.

Exotics desks are often left short gamma by Nikkei-linked autocallables, known as uridashi in Japan. In these products, investors sell banks a downside knock-in put and buy an upside call, which functions as the knock-out barrier. If spot rallies past the upside barrier, investors get their principal back to plus a juicy coupon.

Selling the uridashis gives banks’ exotics desks exposure to deep downside volatility, known as vega. This vega is hedged with more liquid high-strike, short-tenor options. When the uridashi knocks out, exotics desks are suddenly left with these open hedges, giving them short vega and short gamma exposures.

It's not the first time uridashi have caused headaches on exotics desks – in 2013, movements in the Nikkei [led to losses](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/equity-derivatives/2249656/uridashi-losses-put-500-million-after-nikkei-rebounds) of around $500 million across the street.

Given the rapid rise of the index, Byworth says banks were likely to see a number of products knock out, increasing the short gamma positioning. He says the Nikkei’s rally in the days leading up to November 9 would have extended short gamma across the market by a further $200 million by Nomura's calculations.

At the same time, he says banks’ flow desks were left short gamma due to strong upside positioning from macro and real money funds in recent weeks. These investors tend to buy short-tenor upside positions around a January or February expiry, which gives desks a large gamma position.

Market-making desks usually try to cover the short gamma position using flow from other clients or banks, he says, but as spot rallies closer to the investors’ strikes, the short gamma position of the flow desks ramps.

Levered Nikkei-linked ETFs are also inherently short gamma, due to the size and leverage ratio of the outstanding products.  As the market rallies, they need to buy more Nikkei futures, and vice versa, to maintain their market exposure.

“We monitor the size of the levered market in Japan in order to determine the required buying or selling needed to rebalance these funds, which we currently estimate at $275 million for each 1% move in the Nikkei,” says Byworth.

When a desk is short gamma, it is exposed to movements in the underlying but can collect the time-decay premium from the buyer of their options. Given the low volatility environment, market-making desks may not have been fully hedging their short gamma positions to take advantage, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch note claimed.

“It is likely many market-makers did not fully hedge their short gamma risks and were simply delta hedging and collecting decay in the low realised volatility environment,” said the note.

Nikkei Stock Average’s volatility in September and October averaged 15.2 compared with a 21.2 mean for the period between June 2014 and now. The number has pushed up to 18.6 so far in November.

Not everyone agrees, however. Jason Lui, head of equity and derivative strategy for Asia-Pacific at BNP Paribas, says the index may have been influenced by the expiry of the November Nikkei options on November 10 but the abrupt sell-off is likely to have been driven by more macro factors.

He points to the fact that the Bank of Japan did not buy any ETFs on November 9, which led some to believe there would be no central bank support towards the close.

“Our Japan expert, when he analysed the move on that day, realised that the liquidity and beta factor suggests a macro sell-off rather than a kind of fundamental sell-off,” says Lui.

Some backtracking from the index was to be expected, he says, given its rise from around 18,300 in April to 22,261 on November 20.

“For that particular intraday movement, people think it is probably a one-off event, but in terms of the Nikkei as a whole most people do agree there should be a little bit of consolidation because it has rallied so much in such a short period of time and there has been very little change in the macroeconomic fundamentals,” says Lui.
