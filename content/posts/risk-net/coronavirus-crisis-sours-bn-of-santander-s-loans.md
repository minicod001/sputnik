Banco Santander said the economic downturn unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic caused €8 billion ($9.4 billion) of loans to deteriorate in credit quality over the three months to end-June.

The Spanish lender said credit exposures subject to IFRS 9 loan-loss accounting rules amounted to €972 billion in Q2. Of these, €61 billion were classified as stage two, meaning they had experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, up from €53 billion in Q1.

Stage three loans, those that have become impaired, made up €33 billion, flat quarter-on-quarter. Stage one loans, which have not experienced any appreciable rise in credit risk since inception, made up the remaining €878 billion.

The increase in stage two assets may have been greater if it weren’t for regulatory relief measures introduced by European authorities. Santander said it was abiding by European Banking Authority (EBA) guidance that allows banks to hold off designating as stage two those loans subject to payment holidays introduced in the wake of the pandemic.

Regulatory relief measures also helped lift Santander’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio. This hit 11.84% at end-June, up a net 26 basis points on three months prior. A gross 24bp of benefits were reaped directly from interventions made by policymakers, such as the Capital Requirements Regulation ‘quick fix’, which allows firms to negate the capital-sapping effects of additional expected credit loss (ECL) provisions incurred through the pandemic.

### What is it?

In June, European policymakers finalised a flurry of measures to ease the burden of the coronavirus crisis on the banking system. IFRS 9 relief was one, which allows lenders to [‘add back’](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d498.pdf) 100% of stage one and two ECL provisions incurred since January 1 into their regulatory capital to reduce pressure on their core solvency ratios through the Covid-19 pandemic.

The temporary measures apply to end-2021.

### Why it matters

The ECL framework introduced by IFRS 9 has been hastily amended in light of the coronavirus crisis to prevent a sharp build up of loan-loss provisions from eating into banks’ capital buffers. Policymakers justified the action out of fear lenders would choke off the supply of credit to a bruised economy if their capital levels fell close to regulatory minimums.

Additional guidance was issued to amend how banks decide when to move assets from stage one to stage two. Flows from the former to the latter massively increase ECL provisions, as stage two assets require banks to put aside enough reserves to cover lifetime losses.

However, Santander said these measures did not exempt it from “the rigorous application of IFRS 9 in the monitoring of customer credit quality”, which explains the reclassification of the €8 billion of loans.

Whether other European banks will be so thorough remains to be seen. A mishmash of approaches to IFRS 9 would make bank results less comparable, and make life harder for investors and regulators alike to understand their credit risks.
