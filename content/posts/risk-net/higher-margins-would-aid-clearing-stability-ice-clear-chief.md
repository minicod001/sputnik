{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Using volatility floors to aid “higher margins in peacetime” would have to be globally applied policy, warns Serafini_{{< /quote >}}

The head of London’s largest futures clearing house has voiced support for measures that would see clearing house margins stay permanently higher once the current period of heightened volatility sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic subsides.

Speaking at an industry event on June 24, Ice Clear Europe president Hester Serafini voiced tentative support for the idea of reviewing [volatility floors](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7544296/ccps-failing-to-set-effective-margin-limits-study) at CCPs to encourage “more margin stability over time” – but argued any such moves would have to be adopted uniformly across jurisdictions in order to be effective.

Dealers have complained that margins have been kept too low, for too long at listed derivatives clearing houses, and that rates [increased too quickly](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7501541/oil-price-shock-triggers-big-margin-calls) as a result of March’s explosion of volatility. Such procyclicality can put a lot of pressure on dealers to cough up a lot of extra margin in a short period of time, with dealers pointing the finger at [US central counterparties](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7506216/coronavirus-rout-revives-attacks-on-futures-margining) with low margin periods of risk, CCPs in Asia such as [SGX and JSCC](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7513451/asia-ccps-forced-to-hike-margins-rapidly-during-equities-rout), and Canadian exchange group [TMX](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7522851/members-revolt-forces-tmx-to-back-down-on-blanket-margin-hike) during the Covid crisis.

Serafini, who was speaking during a virtual debate at the Futures Industry Association’s International Derivatives Expo, suggested that initial margin did not increase as rapidly at Ice Clear Europe compared with other CCPs.

“If I look at individual contracts, the average increase in March, it’s about 30%,” she said. “I would say the anti-procyclical models that we use at Ice to try to avoid ramping up margins in volatile periods are working quite well.”

Regulators are paying attention to the issue: economists at the Bank for International Settlements recently [warned](https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull13.pdf) that increasing margins during periods of market stress could put “undue pressure on clearing member banks at exactly the wrong time”. The ensuing bank liquidity squeeze could affect the real economy by stifling funding for firms and consumers, the economists argued.

Serafini warned, however, that any move to set a minimum lower bound for futures margin model floors would have to be co-ordinated and applied on a global basis, to prevent CCPs competing on margin.

“It would definitely have to be higher margins in peacetime, rather than lower margins [increases] in volatile times,” added Serafini. “We do think, however, it would be very important that this be applied consistently across different jurisdictions and different regulatory regimes, because if you end up with a situation where in certain jurisdictions these things are not implemented but in others they are, then clients will go to the place in low-volatility times where margins are low and you still don’t get rid of the problem.”

In Europe, CCPs are already required to margin futures contracts on the assumption that it will take two days to close out a defaulter’s portfolio. In a recent [interview](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7560786/eurexs-risk-chief-on-the-need-for-boring-models) with Risk.net, Eurex Clearing chief risk officer Dmitrij Senko called for higher margin periods of risk at clearing houses to make sure margins are not eroded during low-volatility periods. He also claimed that Eurex’s volatility floors worked well to preserve margins, and encouraged their widespread use across the industry.

On the other side of the argument, permanently raising margins would affect liquidity, detractors point out – also undermining market stability. Dealers also have a [vested interested](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/6950491/a-look-under-the-hood-of-span-2-cmes-new-margin-engine) in margins being kept higher, with many getting paid on the basis of total margin paid by a client. Margin also serves as a risk and capital mitigant.

Ice’s Serafini also raised concerns over portability, suggesting the default of a large clearing member during the March bout of volatility would have been difficult to manage for central counterparties, owing to the shrinking pool of viable clearing brokers capable of taking on a large number of clients in the midst of a crisis.

“There are fewer clearing members around, capital requirements are higher, [and] a lot of clearing members have exited the business. The clearing members who are there have larger portfolios now, [but] some of them don’t do certain lines of business any more, so I can see [that with] a default in particular, trying to port portfolios would be a lot harder in the current environment,” she said.

Porting involves [shifting clients](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5073166/cftc-counsel-warns-of-threat-to-clearing-portability) and their positions from one defaulting clearing member to a willing competitor in a time of crisis. Market observers have [long warned](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/3912341/clearing-portability-under-threat-as-fcm-pool-shrinks) that the concentration of clearing into the hands of a [small number](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7563331/client-margin-up-40-at-morgan-stanleys-swaps-unit-in-q1) of futures commission merchants following the decision of several once-sizeable providers to quit the business will make this harder. The recent [exit](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7517576/rbs-exits-listed-derivatives-trading-and-clearing) of Royal Bank of Scotland from listed derivatives execution and clearing is one example.

As Serafini suggested, bank FCMs have long blamed the risk capital framework for making the clearing business difficult to make a return from. Firms that clear for proprietary traders, for example, have seen exposures measured using the current exposure method [balloon](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7530856/leverage-ratio-squeeze-hits-options-trades) during the recent volatile period, and many have [called for](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7427951/eu-banks-rue-sa-ccr-mismatch-with-us) an earlier implementation of the standardised approach to counterparty credit risk.

“I would urge regulators to reconsider, and maybe continue to relax or make more flexible some of these capital requirements,” she added. “Part of the reason why we moved to clearing was because in the past, porting and things like that worked really well, and we don’t want to have that broken when the next default happens.”

Historically, client margin has not counted as a mitigant against a bank’s derivatives exposure. The Basel Committee for Banking Supervision recently made [amendments](http://www.risk.net/regulation/6747066/basel-closes-in-on-im-offset-for-leverage-ratio) to make these capital rules more accommodating for clearing firms.
