{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Banks pushed onto internal models wrestle with procyclical capital charges_{{< /quote >}}

With the coronavirus crisis rattling markets and undermining the creditworthiness of even rock-solid firms, US banks have seen risks gauged using their own models leap higher relative to regulator-set standardised measures. Given that the latter are far clunkier than banks’ internal indicators and respond more slowly to changing credit conditions, this could have wide-ranging implications for capital allocation.

As of end-March, three systemically important US banks – Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley – had higher risk-weighted assets (RWAs) under the advanced approaches (AA) than under the standardised approaches (SA). The AA use banks’ own models to gauge credit, market and operational risks.

Under [US prudential rules](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/6376441/we-need-to-talk-about-collins), this means their binding risk-based capital requirements are now [determined](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7525951/citi-goldman-edge-above-collins-floor) using the AA measure (see figure 1). For Citi and Morgan Stanley, it’s the first time they’ve been under the AA since early 2017. Goldman was last bound by the AA in Q3 2019.

Beyond its impact on strategic decision making, in the near term, the spike in modelled RWAs is already having a dramatic effect on big banks’ credit and derivatives exposures. The larger unknown is the interplay with the US Federal Reserve’s soon-to-be-imposed Stress Capital Buffer, which is likely to make SAs the binding constraint for most lenders – something which could have an equally dramatic effect on banks’ willingness to invest in their modelling apparatus.

The switch to a capital regime set using their own models is stimulating a rethink of how equity is deployed firm-wide.

“We are certainly thinking about it in the near term in our allocation of balance sheet,” says Rahul Soni, head of capital planning at Citi in New York. “But we’re doing it in the mindset of wanting to support clients. Longer term, as the recovery happens, I think the balance-sheet allocation determinations will continue to be made on whatever the binding constraint is.”

One business where AA capital charges could [bite](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7559521/cva-capital-charges-jumped-50-at-systemic-us-banks-in-q1) is non-cleared derivatives. Under the AA, banks have to calculate credit valuation adjustment (CVA) requirements to cover counterparty credit risk. No such charge exists under the standardised approach.

“CVA models are VAR [value-at-risk] models, essentially, so RWAs go up in stressful periods. Exposures went up, too, in the first quarter. So CVA had a lot to do with the narrowing delta between standardised and advanced,” says a capital manager at a second systemic US bank.

Over the first quarter, CVA RWAs [leapt 50%](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7559521/cva-capital-charges-jumped-50-at-systemic-us-banks-in-q1) in aggregate at the eight US systemic banks. Citi’s and Goldman’s measures vaulted 81% and 76% respectively.

“In terms of capital management, the AA changes things. You need to consider the factors that drive the CVA charge – client quality and the maturity of an exposure, because those are all factors that change how the AA moves that don’t matter under the standardised approaches,” says the capital manager.

Overall, Goldman Sachs’s AA RWAs for derivatives increased a whopping 44% under the AA, compared with just 11% under the standardised approaches. At Morgan Stanley, AA derivatives RWAs increased $31.1 billion over the quarter – almost two-and-a-half times greater than they did under the SA.

Roiling credit markets at the end of March largely powered these moves. As CVA requirements are typically set using a counterparty’s credit default swap spreads, they can become volatile in a panic.

Although spreads have narrowed in recent weeks, the long shadow the coronavirus has cast over the US economy means that AA values could start to rise faster than standardised across other portfolios, too.

“The internal models approach is inherently more procyclical than the standardised approach,” says Allison Breault, a lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb and former attorney at the US Federal Reserve Board. “Although the CARES [Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security] Act has given relief on the requirement to put some assets in the troubled debt restructuring category, and the [CECL [Current Expected Credit Loss] relief](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7517556/cecl-delay-grants-mid-sized-us-banks-a-capital-windfall) is in effect, because models use internal probability of default [PD] estimates that are meant to be dynamic, they wouldn’t be fit for purpose if they didn’t turn out higher risk weights now than they did prior to the Covid downturn,” she adds.

Corporate PD estimates did [edge higher last quarter](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7554266/corporate-loan-default-risk-spiked-at-us-g-sibs-in-q1), but overall risk weights for these exposures barely budged to 40.2% from 39.9% at end-2019. Francisco Covas, head of research at the Bank Policy Institute in Washington, DC, says a huge chunk of the new exposures banks took on in the first quarter were credit lines drawn down by blue-chip clients, which put downward pressure on their portfolio-level PDs.

However, with macro indicators turning red, the overall risk profile of banks’ loan books may now be shifting.

“Because the US is officially in a recession, we could see a further increase in weighted average PDs and risk weights at the end of the second quarter,” says Covas.

Standardised RWAs would also climb in the midst of a recession, but what distinguishes the AA is that wobbly credits will attract higher capital charges at a faster clip as banks’ reset default estimates in real time. This could lead those bound by the AA to become more miserly.

“What matters is the long-run evolution of RWAs,” says Sean Campbell, head of policy research at the [Financial Services Forum](https://www.fsforum.com/about/members/), a lobby group set up by the eight systemic banks.

“All our firms are thinking about that now. What matters for asset allocation is not the overall level of RWAs, but the relative RWAs across different business lines. That determines whether business A or business B has a greater or lesser incentive to get funded.”

These considerations may vary depending on whether a firm is under the advanced or standardised approaches, as relative charges look different under each lens.

Although AA RWAs are expected to keep spiralling higher in the coming months, their relevance to systemic lenders’ capital management may yet fade away because of the implementation of the Federal Reserve’s [stress capital buffer](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7501576/the-feds-stress-capital-buffer-relaxed-but-not-relaxing) (SCB), which will take effect on [October 1](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20200304a2.pdf).

The new buffer sweeps away the clutter of old prudential add-ons, and will anchor capital requirements to a firm’s performance through the Fed’s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress tests. The SCB only applies to standardised RWAs, however. This means if a firm’s capital requirement under the AA, plus a mandatory 2.5% capital conservation buffer, is lower than that produced by the SA plus the SCB, then the AA is disregarded from a regulatory standpoint.

Many systemic US banks project their SCBs to be higher than the capital conservation buffer, meaning most firms will likely be bound by the SA, even if their basic standardised RWAs are lower than those under the AA.

“That’s going to disincentivise your reliance on the AA,” says Jacques Schillaci, a lawyer specialising in bank capital at Linklaters in New York.

“If a bank is stuck with the SA, it may put off investing resources in developing a good AA mechanic – they’ll only invest money if it saves them money. In terms of how Covid affects that, it depends how long the crisis goes on and how distressed assets become.”

Still, even if the revival of the AA as a determinant of risk-based requirements is short-lived, capital managers argue their internal models have proven their worth through the crisis.

“It provides a better measure to assess the riskiness of their portfolio, as standardised is a one-size-fits-all approach, which may not capture the nuance of risks in certain structured transactions and overstate the risk relative to events,” says Citi’s Soni.
