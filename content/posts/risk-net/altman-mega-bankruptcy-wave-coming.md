The coronavirus pandemic is expected to bring a record number of corporate bankruptcies in the US, but lenders should have spotted signs of elevated credit risk before the crisis struck, new research suggests.

Corporate and government debt approached “dangerous levels” in the first two months of 2020, according to a study by academic Edward Altman, professor at New York’s Stern School of Business. This marked the end of a 10-year credit cycle during which non-financial corporate debt rose to new highs compared with GDP.

The [paper](https://www.risk.net/journal-of-credit-risk/7566491/covid-19-and-the-credit-cycle), published in the Journal of Credit Risk, has implications for banks and their efforts to model likely defaults of borrowers in the wake of the pandemic.

Altman is the architect of a measure of credit strength known as the Z-score. The [metric](https://www.risk.net/journal-of-credit-risk/6201816/a-fifty-year-retrospective-on-credit-risk-models-the-altman-z-score-family-of-models-and-their-applications-to-financial-markets-and-managerial-strategies), first developed in the 1960s, combines five financial indicators to provide a figure showing probability of bankruptcy.

By applying a Z-score to a sample of more than 600 US corporate borrowers with a credit rating of BBB, Altman finds that between 34% and 36% of the firms are overrated, and instead warrant a rating of BB or even B, as of December 2019.

The finding is significant because BBB is the lowest investment-grade rating before bond issuers slip into the high-yield category. By Altman’s calculations, between $500 billion and $625 billion from the $2.5 trillion total of BBB bonds will be downgraded to high-yield status over the next two years.

Once in the high-yield pool, borrowers will struggle to finance themselves in the same way, since many investors are bound by mandates that prevent them from buying so-called junk bonds. The squeeze on financing will precipitate a slew of bankruptcies: Altman predicts 61 Chapter 11 filings of more than $1 billion this year, known as ‘mega-bankruptcies’.

Nor can companies expect to switch from debt capital markets to equity financing as easily as they might think, Altman suggests. “The associated rise in the stock market in this period gave companies confidence that should the boom in debt end, they could, if they were quick, switch to equity financing, should they need to deleverage or simply find a substitute type of financing,” he says.

But a slump in debt is much more likely to be accompanied by a simultaneous slump in equity. After the 2008 financial crisis, the correlation between risky debt and equity markets rose dramatically, from normal levels of 0.4–0.5 to around 0.7.

The findings give credence to the idea that many credit models used by banks are ill-equipped to accurately forecast [losses](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7528771/covid-loan-losses-exceed-2019-ccar-projections) following a severe or unexpected shock. Most loan-loss models rely on selectively replaying the past to predict the future. Faced with a unique event such as the coronavirus pandemic, models are [struggling to adapt](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7511401/as-covid-snaps-credit-models-lenders-turn-to-stress-testing).

Altman’s Z-score indicates that rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s have been persistently overvaluing corporate creditors in the BBB category for at least the last 12 years. Experts have [observed](https://www.risk.net/comment/7562771/scared-of-fallen-angels-so-are-the-rating-agencies) a ‘downward stickiness’ at the BBB level, where agencies seem reluctant to push credits into junk territory.

Previous [research](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~ealtman/TheEffectsofRatingThroughtheCycleonRatingStability.pdf) by Altman with Dutch economist Herbert Rijken suggests that rating agencies are slow to downgrade, and even keep downgraded companies at a higher rating than their credit quality deserves.

The result has been a bulge bracket of BBB debt teetering on the brink of high-yield status. At the end of 2019, a record 52% of all investment-grade US corporate bonds were rated BBB.

Rating agencies expect only around 10% of this debt to be downgraded to junk. But with no end in sight for the pandemic in the US, Altman believes agencies will be forced to revise upwards their forecasts.

A sudden influx of fallen angels will create problems for existing junk bond issuers. The junk market is small – at the end of 2019, it stood at $1.5 trillion – and investors will prefer to invest in recently downgraded firms rather than marginal junk issuers, crowding them out, Altman predicts. Previous crises did not experience crowding out because the BBB market was far smaller then.

Based on the relationship between Z-score and default risk, the paper estimates that high-yield bonds and leveraged loans will default at 8.6–9% in 2020.

So far this year, commercial bankruptcies are rising. June saw 609 Chapter 11 filings across the US, compared with 424 in June 2019; 2020 so far has seen 3,604, compared with 2,855 in the first half of 2019. While February and March saw similar numbers to the average for those months in the previous nine years, rates have risen since the pandemic has reached US shores in force, hitting a 10-year high of 723 in May.
