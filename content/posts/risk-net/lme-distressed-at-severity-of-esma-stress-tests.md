> _Watchdog’s simulated price shocks said to be unprecedented in metals markets_

The London Metal Exchange is understood to have been left frustrated by its [failing grade](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7654491/lme-clear-stretched-by-ccp-stress-tests) in the European Securities and Markets Authority’s clearing house stress test this week, after the watchdog subjected its default resources to price shocks that were up to three times more severe than the worst one-day falls on record in key base metal markets.

On July 13, Esma released the [results](https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma%E2%80%99s-third-eu-wide-ccp-stress-test-finds-system-resilient-shocks) of a stress test for Europe’s largest central counterparties, which simulated two scenarios: a large price shock along with the default of each CCP’s two largest clearing members, and, separately, a price shock accompanied by the default of the single set of two clearing members, which would collectively cause the biggest drain on financial resources at each CCP.

The tests were conducted on the basis of participants’ balance sheets as of December 2018 and March 2019. The second stress test found LME Clear would incur €712 million in losses, exceeding its €446 million default fund by €266 million – an amount that would have to be met by cash calls to its clearing members. LME was the only CCP in the test to exceed its default resources.

Risk.net understands Esma’s shock was considerably in excess of the hypothetical stress scenarios the LME uses to size its default fund. The test envisaged the bourse’s aluminium, copper, nickel, lead, tin and zinc contracts all falling to a considerably larger degree than any have previously on the same day.

It is understood that aluminium prices, for instance, were shocked by -14%. The biggest one-day move for aluminium was a drop of -4.3%, in the immediate aftermath of the default of Lehman Brothers; its biggest two-day move is just under -12%.

The stress test comes amid [scrutiny](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7506216/coronavirus-rout-revives-attacks-on-futures-margining) of futures and options clearing house margin models, as Covid-19 ravaged markets in March and April. Multiple clearing banks and [some CCPs](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7560786/eurexs-risk-chief-on-the-need-for-boring-models) have suggested the [procyclicality](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7513451/asia-ccps-forced-to-hike-margins-rapidly-during-equities-rout) demonstrated in some clearers’ models during the March market rout mean [margin floors](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7544296/ccps-failing-to-set-effective-margin-limits-study) need to be set higher, with lengthier margin periods of risk.

Commodity clearers in particular often counter that margining on the basis of more than two days’ worth of price moves would force margins higher to such a degree that smaller producers and consumers would be locked out of markets, damaging liquidity and price discovery.

Under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, CCPs are required to set initial margin on the basis of two-days’ worth of net price moves, close to close, on the assumption that it will take two days to close out a defaulter’s portfolio.

In a statement, an LME spokesperson drew attention to this apparent disparity.

“LME Clear has been designed from the outset to manage risk in the exchange-traded metal derivative markets, and our systems are designed to take into account the distinct characteristics of those markets,” the statement reads.

“The nature of these markets and our historical and hypothetical scenarios lead us to the conclusion a two-day price shock is the appropriate test for exchange-traded metal derivatives – consistent with Emir requirements for CCPs clearing futures business. The Esma stress exercises are designed with a five-day price shock in mind. As such we remain confident that our financial resources and default waterfall processes are fully adequate and appropriate for the markets we clear.”

Extreme [price dislocations](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7501541/oil-price-shock-triggers-big-margin-calls) are not unheard of in commodity markets, however. During the Covid lockdown-induced selloff that engulfed markets in March, the LME’s copper contract saw successive days of heavy selling, with falls of as much as -9% on March 18. Aluminium, zinc, tin and lead prices all saw intraday price drops of more than -4% the following day.

Conversely, idiosyncratic factors affecting the supply dynamics of a market can have a pronounced effect on [individual contracts](https://www.risk.net/commodities/7546071/bachelier-a-strange-new-world-for-oil-options). LME Nickel prices rocketed by more than 10% in April 2018, when Russian producers were hit by a fresh round of US economic sanctions.

As of end-March 2020, LME Clear had prefunded default resources, beyond initial margin, of $862 million, up from $472 million the same quarter a year ago.

### Covid-strength stresses

Esma’s report on its stress tests suggested all the scenarios used were of “comparable severity” to the market stresses experienced amid the Covid-19 market scare in March and April, with only “limited exceptions”.

“The scenarios can be used to assess the resiliency of CCPs under hypothetical extreme but plausible market movements,” says the report.

Fabrizio Planta, the head of markets and data reporting at Esma, said at a July 13 press briefing that the LME’s lead regulator – the Bank of England – “reacted immediately” upon being notified of the failure, after Esma had informed the LME’s college of supervisors.

“We will certainly analyse if… this would require certain changes to their margin models,” he said. “It’s too early to say.”

In the wake of an unprecedented number of margin breaches among global CCPs, some market participants have questioned whether or not liquidity and concentration add-ons are appropriately [calibrated](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7522851/members-revolt-forces-tmx-to-back-down-on-blanket-margin-hike) across global CCPs.

In response to a question from Risk.net at the July 13 press conference, Planta suggested Esma was looking into liquidity risk add-ons and their current application across the Union.

“Certainly, additional guidance is needed and is something that is in our work pipeline,” he said.

Esma did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
