> _Also: Wirecard dominates legacy losses; SEB hit with massive AML fine. Data by ORX News_

June’s largest loss was Nordic lender SEB’s [$107 million](https://www.fi.se/en/published/press-releases/2020/seb-receives-an-administrative-fine-for-deficiencies-in-its-work-to-combat-anti-money-laundering-in-the-baltics/) fine for anti-money laundering failures in its Baltic operations. This is the second fine for AML failure handed out this year by the Swedish regulator (FI), which in March fined Swedbank $397 million for similar failures in its Baltic subsidiaries.

FI’s investigation covered the period between 2015 and the first quarter of 2019, in which period it found the bank had insufficient governance and control of Baltic subsidiary banks with regard to AML. It identified that the bank had deficiencies in identifying and managing the risk of money laundering in respect of non-resident customers and of resident customers with non-resident owners. Nor did it identify and manage the elevated compliance and reputational risks that some of these customers imposed on the group.

Despite repeatedly receiving information about deficiencies in some of the central pillars of AML work in the Baltics, SEB did not take sufficient action. Furthermore, the investigation found, the Baltic subsidiary banks did not have sufficient resources to combat money laundering.

FI ordered SEB to redesign its automated transaction monitoring system and to ensure it assesses transactions that its system has flagged as suspicious. SEB has until July 30, 2021 to report that it has complied with the terms of the order.

The Estonian regulator, FSA, also fined SEB’s Estonian subsidiary, SEB Pank, €1 million ($1.14 billion) for its AML failures.

In June’s second largest loss, MetLife paid [$84 million](https://www.law360.com/insurance/articles/1281486?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=section) to settle a class action over claims the company underreported the value of its life insurance death-benefit backup funds. The misrepresentation caused investors to purchase common stocks at an artificially inflated price. On June 11, 2020, the preliminary approval for the settlement was rejected in court over a legal technicality. However, ORX has kept the story in its database, as MetLife had agreed to pay and provision that amount to settle the case. The motion may be approved at a later date.

The class action of investors alleged that in 2007, MetLife had a $25 million shortfall in its backup funds that it held for incurred but not reported death-benefit claims. The litigation alleged that MetLife had knowingly omitted the shortfall when presenting its financial statements in quarters following the discovery in 2007. As a result, the class alleged that in 2010, the company’s stock was traded at artificially inflated price.

The judge said that the investors must resubmit a motion that does not suggest that the court expresses a view as to the fairness of the settlement.

June’s third largest loss occurred at JP Morgan Chase, in which Chase Bank settled a lawsuit brought by US military servicemembers for [$62.5 million.](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-146)

The suit alleged that Chase had violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) by charging illegal interest rates and improper fees. Under SCRA, all debts incurred by service members before being called to active duty are reduced to a 6% interest rate. Under its own program, Chase represented that during servicemembers’ active military service, all debts would accrue interest at 4% and that all fees would be waived.

The class action alleged that Chase had charged more than 6% interest and failed to forgive overcharged interest. As a result, the bank improperly inflated the balances on servicemembers’ accounts and collected compound interest. In addition, the class action alleged that Chase had violated the Truth in Lending Act by making material misrepresentations about the servicemembers’ interest rates.

In settling the case, the bank did not admit any wrongdoing, but agreed to pay $62.5 million in compensation to class members.

South Africa’s Postbank incurred June’s fourth largest loss of [$62.1 million](https://savannanews.com/postbank-forced-to-replace-12-million-bank-cards-after-employees-steal-master-key/) after employees printed off and stole the master key the bank uses to control customer accounts. Employees reportedly printed the key in plain, unencrypted language and in clear text on at least one laptop. The theft occurred during a data centre move in July 2018. Social grant beneficiaries were the most affected by the incident as the perpetrators were able to steal a total of $3.35 million from these accounts. By December 2019, bank officials had registered around 25,000 fraudulent transactions on their systems, occurring between March 2019 and December 2019.

In September 2019, South Africa’s Reserve Bank set Postbank a deadline of 18 months to replace 12 million compromised cards at a cost of $58.7 million.

In June’s fifth largest loss, Commerzbank was fined [$47.7 million](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-commerzbank-london-37805400-over-anti-money-laundering-failures) by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority for AML systems and controls failures.

The FCA found Commerzbank London’s financial crime control applicable to intermediaries was inadequate, and that certain business areas did not always adhere to Commerzbank London’s own policy of verifying the beneficial ownership of clients. Furthermore, a significant backlog of existing clients requiring timely refreshed know-your-client checks, developed in part because of understaffing problems at the bank. The FCA also found there was a lack of clarity around responsibilities throughout several departments.

Commerzbank London’s systems and controls failures occurred between October 2012 and September 2017. As the bank agreed to resolve the matter at an early stage of the investigation, it qualified for a 30% discount.

### Spotlight: Telegram falls foul of SEC with bogus cryptocurrency

Messaging provider Telegram was fined [$18.5 million](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-146) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an illegal offering of securities between January 2018 and March 2018.

Under the securities’ purchase agreement, a Telegram subsidiary was to issue a new cryptocurrency by the name of Grams. The SEC deemed Grams was not in fact a cryptocurrency, as no products or services could be purchased with it. Instead, the SEC found Grams to be a security, as investors expected to profit from its purchase if Telegram delivered on the promised functionalities.

Telegram had hoped to use the proceeds from selling Grams to fund the development of its new blockchain technology and had planned a secondary offering of Grams in October 2019.

Because the SEC considered Grams a security, it was able to secure an injunction against the secondary offering of Grams, as Telegram had failed to file a registration statement with the regulator.

In consenting to the final judgement, Telegram agreed to pay a civil penalty of $18.5 million. Furthermore, the judgement ordered the company to return $1.22 billion of funds to investors.

### In focus: H1 op risk losses roughly halved vs 2019

For the first half of 2020, total op risk losses at financial firms were approximately half of recorded losses for the same period last year. ORX News recorded $7.93 billion in op risk losses between January 1 and June 30, 2020, versus a total of $14.28 billion in losses for the first six months of 2019. Of this total, $8.4 billion was recorded at the time and $5.8 billion constitutes legacy losses that have since come to light. The frequency of publicly reported op risk events has also decreased compared with last year by 35%.

While a combination of factors may account for the fall in op risk losses, the [Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7561696/banks-eye-post-pandemic-shake-up-of-op-risk-scenarios) is prime among them. Evidence suggests  regulators around the world have focused more on helping firms weather the crisis instead of imposing fines and penalties. In May, when the US and Europe were in near-total lockdown, just [€76 million](https://www.risk.net/comment/7541566/op-risk-data-ibk-snagged-in-money-laundering-ops-to-iran) of op risk fines were recorded – one of the lowest monthly tallies ever seen. Misconduct fell sharply compared with the first half of 2019; it accounted for just 28% of the total loss amount so far for this year – down from 74% last year.

Despite the shift in regulators’ approach during the first half of the year, regulatory fines began to rise again in June. Two of 2020’s largest losses in the category of ‘improper business or market practices’ took place in June. SEB Group was fined $107.3 million for anti-money laundering failures in its Baltic operations (see this month’s Top 5). And [ABN Amro](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7519431/op-risk-data-outsourcing-losses-loom-in-lockdown) disclosed that it had paid $338.4 million to Italian tax authorities over alleged cum-ex trading by one of its subsidiaries between 2004 and 2008.

External theft and fraud this year accounts for 55% of the op risk total losses; however, the frequency of such events has fallen, with 37% of op risk events being assigned to this category. Nearly three quarters (74%) of these losses were incurred by banks that had credit agreements with Singaporean oil trader Hin Leong. In total, 21 banks incurred a total of $3.68 billion in losses in this respect. Individual reported amounts include $600 million at HSBC, $300 million at ABN Amro, $290 million at UBS and $250 million at OCBC Bank. Other large external fraud losses include VTB’s $535 million loss in the Mozambique loan fraud scheme.

Commercial banking was the most frequently affected business line, accounting for 30% of events in the year-to-date; many of the largest losses also occurred in this business line as part of the collapse of the aforementioned Hin Leong. And while retail banking was the second most frequently affected business line, losses in this business line accounted for only around 13% of total losses.

During the pandemic, many firms are focused on trying to continue with business as usual and many are yet to formally report op risk losses due to the pandemic. However, firms have reported signs of an elevated exposure to some risks caused, for example, by increased [phishing attacks](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7649391/hacking-threats-growing-in-work-from-home-era-fear-cisos) related to the pandemic or the huge shift to home working and other business process changes.
