> _From gender discrimination to the next PPI, a veteran manager looks at forthcoming potential op risks_

In the final article accompanying Risk.net’s [top 10 operational risks for 2018](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/5424761/top-10-operational-risks-for-2018), a veteran op risk manager at a large global bank looks at what emerging threats might make it on to a future list.

Mis-selling [slipped](https://www.risk.net/5423321?utm_source=article&utm_medium=risk.net&utm_campaign=Top10oprisk1810) a place on 2018’s top 10 op risks – perhaps because [last year’s](https://www.risk.net/comment/5384771/top-10-op-risk-losses-of-2017-crisis-era-fines-abate) crop of fines was so much smaller than in previous years, which were skewed by vast payouts by all banks for mortgage mis-selling, and, in the UK, compensation for payment protection insurance, or PPI. A deadline for new claims on the latter has been set, and the bulk of compensation paid out – but banks would be foolish to assume something else won’t take its place.

As with the majority of mis-selling cases, it could take a severe economic downturn to precipitate the next big class of claims, whereby customers start to lose money on poorly structured or plain ill-advised financial products.

A downturn could materialise in any number of ways; for the UK, exit from the European Union could be a trigger. One outcome of Brexit could be a 1970s-style burst of stagflation – an economic downturn coinciding with rising inflation, caused by an old-fashioned sterling crisis. This would lead to both rising unemployment and a spike in mortgage defaults.

Although such an economic outcome would lead primarily to credit losses, given the UK’s post-PPI litigation culture – witness the cottage industry of claims management agencies that has sprung up to represent PPI victims – there may also be attendant claims for compensation against banks for either irresponsible lending or failing to treat customers in financial difficulty fairly; especially as around a fifth of all outstanding residential mortgages in the UK are interest-only, according to data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders. This gives rise to concerns of a potential repayment crisis, and, consequently, potential claims that banks had failed to carry out their affordability assessments correctly.

In addition, the financial crisis was notable for banks reaching settlements with retail customers and smaller businesses that were in financial difficulties, and ill-treated by their banks on both sides of the Atlantic. The $25 billion foreclosure-abuse settlement reached by five banks in the US in February 2012 over a range of failures including inaccurately applying repayments and charging excessive and improper fees, is one example. Closer to home, litigation and regulatory review continues regarding the operation of [RBS’s](https://www.rbs.com/rbs/GRGComplaintsProcess.html)Global Restructuring Group, as well as [HBoS’s](http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/Media/Press-Releases/press-releases-2017/lloyds-banking-group/update-on-hbos-reading-customer-reviews-and-appointment-of-independent-legal-expert/) impaired assets division.

The root causes of many of these issues in both the US and UK were often a lack of adequately trained staff, and/or poor management oversight. After a decade of cost cutting, there remain significant concerns that UK retail banks would risk being under-resourced to deal appropriately with any future significant spike in defaults.

In trying to address deficiencies with either existing regulations or the control frameworks of banks, [regulators often](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/5423346/top-10-op-risks-2018-regulatory-risk) introduce new rules which have unforeseen consequences.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s new approach to calculating Pillar 1 operational risk capital is simple and comparable between banks and potentially penalises firms for their historical operational risk losses. A by-product of this simplicity, however, is that all revenues attract the same levels of operational risk capital.

For firms that are trying to optimise their return on regulatory capital, the standardised measurement approach ([SMA](https://www.risk.net/topics/standardised-measurement-approach-sma)) will, arguably, incentivise them to provide clients with more services that generate fee income, as it is treated [more favourably](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5387256/chinese-megabanks-set-to-lose-out-in-switch-to-sma) for regulatory capital than either interest income or trading income.

However, fee-generating services such as M&A advisory, payments, fund management, structuring securities and selling insurance and investments have historically produced some of the largest operational risk losses (eg, the mortgage mis-selling litigation and [anti-money laundering](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/5423356/top-10-op-risks-2018-theft-and-fraud) settlements in the US and mis-sale of PPI, private pensions and endowment policies in the UK).

As the SMA does not contain any forward-looking element, there would be no incremental capital required for creating and selling high margin and complex products, such as the recently terminated [short Vix notes](http://www.risk.net/derivatives/5405726/xiv-hedging-rule-helped-protect-credit-suisse), which lost upwards of 90% of their value in a day.

In addition, the introduction of more prescriptive rules for specific risks, such as US regulators’ focus on [third-party risk management](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5423361/top-10-op-risks-2018-outsourcing) and the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation will redirect operational risk managers towards overseeing these granular processes and away from focusing on less obvious but potentially more costly sources of risk, which the SMA may be inadvertently encouraging their banks to take. In a worst-case scenario, this could ultimately lead to future waves of misconduct; investor and customer losses and expensive compensation claims.

Past tolerance of everyday gender discrimination and outright harassment in multiple industries is fast evaporating – and banking is no different. This is likely to herald an increase in claims against firms for past failures in investigating individual instances of sexual harassment; it may also usher in a new wave of litigation for systemic gender discrimination.

Class actions arising from gender discrimination are not a new phenomenon: for example, in July 2004 Morgan Stanley reached a $54 million settlement over [claim](https://www.leighday.co.uk/News/News-2018/February-2018/Leigh-Day-launch-£4bn-equal-pay-claim-against-TESC)s from 340 women regarding pay discrepancies and exclusion from promotion processes. The recent class action [claim](https://www.leighday.co.uk/News/News-2018/February-2018/Leigh-Day-launch-£4bn-equal-pay-claim-against-TESC) lodged against Tesco is unlikely to be a one-off, either, due to the introduction in the UK of statutory requirements to disclose the gender pay-gap of firms. The emergence of litigation funds to finance class action lawsuits may also help to fuel further [claim](https://www.leighday.co.uk/News/News-2018/February-2018/Leigh-Day-launch-£4bn-equal-pay-claim-against-TESC)s.

In addition, changing attitudes are also leading to details becoming public of historic individual cases of sexual harassment, which were dealt with internally, but without punishment for the alleged wrongdoers: witness recent reports of historical sexual harassment claims being made against partners of law firms, for example.

What will prove most damaging about these claims is the extent to which a pattern emerges in the firms’ responses – if HR departments systematically arranged for victims of alleged sexual harassment to leave their firms with financial settlements after signing non-disclosure agreements, while the male partners remained in situ, for example.
