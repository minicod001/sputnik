The futures market’s dawdling on Libor transition is impeding adoption of risk-free rates in the swaptions market and creating barriers to the development of swap markets linked to the new benchmarks, according to senior interest rate traders.

Tom Prickett, co-head of rates trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at JP Morgan, called the [limited development in the futures marke](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7485506/sonia-swaps-surge-not-mirrored-by-futures)t the “elephant in the room” when it comes to transitioning from Libor, noting that eurodollar and short-sterling futures volumes far eclipse their replacement risk-free rate alternatives, such as the sterling overnight index average (Sonia) and the US secured overnight financing rate (SOFR).

“Until those markets move across it’s very hard to see the option market successfully moving across, because the two are quite hand in hand. A lot of the hedging of swaption contracts is done through exchange-traded products. There needs to be a bit more focus on the futures market and how we can try to encourage that market to transition,” said Prickett, speaking on a webinar on June 23 as part of Risk.net’s [Libor Virtual Week](https://events.risk.net/libor-uk).

Prickett said futures based on the alternative rates will have to reach a threshold level of liquidity to encourage high-frequency market-makers to transition as well.

“Perhaps you start to incentivise some market-making schemes in the new risk-free rate futures so that liquidity is built up a bit more rapidly,” he said, adding that he was aware of discussions taking place on the issue.

Curve Global, CME and Ice were unable to comment before publication.

Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have recorded [SOFR swaption trades](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7426356/goldman-jpm-kick-off-sofr-swaptions) and a handful of dealers are offering [Sonia swaptions](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6914531/dealers-dip-toe-into-sonia-swaptions-market), but relatively few swaptions have been printed against risk-free rates so far.

Risk.net found that only three swaptions trades referencing Sonia or SOFR have been reported to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s swap data repository since 2017. The DTCC data captures trades involving at least one US-regulated counterparty.

Speaking on a [separate webinar](https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&referrer=&eventid=2340960&sessionid=1&key=D734001D94ABD4BA3842854EB00C6E16&regTag=1020700&sourcepage=register) on the same day, buy-side executives said Sonia swaptions were not a huge attraction at the moment.

“It’s still a little bit of a nascent market. The issue there is not so much to do with the product design, but the fact that structurally, with interest rates being as low and curves as flat as they are at the moment, our clients have just less structural need for swaptions. As a result, we’ve probably been spending less time focusing on those aspects of the reform,” said Nabil Owadally, a liability-driven investment (LDI) portfolio manager at BMO Global Asset Management.

“Nonetheless, steps in the right direction are being taken with the consultation on the Ice swap rate for Sonia and the expansion of the dataset to include Tradeweb prices, which should help to reduce the incidence of no publications,” he added.

Barry Hadingham, head of derivatives and counterparty risk at Aviva Investors, said on the same webinar that Aviva is interested in Sonia swaptions, but agreed it was a fledgling market.

“Clearly, I can think of cases across our business, and not necessarily just on the LDI side, where we would look to use them, but there is no real market at the moment,” he said.

### Feedback loop

Ivan Jossang, a managing director in the fixed income division at Morgan Stanley, said the lack of risk-free rate swaptions activity is holding back the development of the related swaps market. That’s because traders prefer to hedge Libor-based swaptions with Libor swaps, resulting in a “chicken and egg” scenario where each market could use the other market’s move as a catalyst.

“There was a hope and an expectation that increasing liquidity in the Sonia [swaps] market would naturally pull the swaption market with it. But what we’ve seen is that the continued hedging requirement for these Libor swaption positions has actually maintained a certain high level of Libor swap trading,” said Jossang, speaking on the same Risk.net webinar.

Jossang added that increased adoption of risk-free rates in the interest rate option market also depends on developments in the loan market.

For instance, borrowers often have to buy an interest rate option called a cap to hedge interest rate risk. If the interest rate exceeds the strike on the cap, the borrower receives payments to offset its costs. Ideally, the hedge would reference the same rate as the loan, but with loans being slow to migrate off Libor, so have caps.

The situation creates another feedback loop where loan standards and interest rate option liquidity hinder each other from moving forward in the transition.

“You could well anticipate that when the loan market manages to transition to overnight rates in more meaningful scale, we will also see a quite meaningful uptick in activity in caps linked to risk-free reference rates,” said Jossang.

### Crucial six months

Market participants see the next six months as key to the Libor transition, with clearing houses due to shift discounting rates for euro and US dollar interest rate swaps to reference their respective risk-free rates, and final fallback protocols set to be published and signed.

But beyond the market’s lead movers in the LDI space, Jossang said many buy-side firms have to yet to actively transition their books off Libor.

“I still think there’s an enormous amount of additional inventory that could be transitioned ahead of time relative to what’s actually been done to date. I’d be very surprised if it [the Libor inventory] has come down over the last year. If anything, I imagine it’s probably increased quite substantially,” he said.

Speaking on the same webinar, Tradeweb’s head of European interest rate derivatives, Bhas Nalabothula, said there is a clear difference between those leading firms and the rest of the buy side.

“When you look down the broad list of sterling derivatives users, the majority haven’t taken advantage of transitioning their portfolios, whether it be electronically on venues such as Tradeweb or voice,” he said.
