{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Funds are embracing stress-testing, and swing pricing, after “a real liquidity crisis” in March_{{< /quote >}}

The heavy outflows from retail funds in March have softened the attitudes of some asset managers who were resistant to upcoming [requirements](https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma34-39-882_final_report_guidelines_on_lst_in_ucits_and_aifs.pdf) on liquidity stress-testing, published by the European Securities and Markets Authority last year.

“Esma came out with those guidelines, which were pretty stringent, which we thought maybe were going too far. Looking back at it, some of them are very useful,” said Michael Derwael, a Luxembourg-based risk manager at MFS Investment Management.

Esma’s guidelines require fund managers to run their portfolios through [a variety of redemption shocks](https://www.risk.net/investing/risk-management/7503006/funds-try-to-predict-behaviour-of-mystery-investors). These include historical events, such as the 2008 financial crisis, and hypothetical scenarios – widening credit spreads or a global pandemic, for example.

Another useful practice, Derwael noted, is reverse stress-testing – a technique Esma recommends rather than requires in its guidelines. Reverse stress tests take a hypothetical outcome – say, a fund’s failure to meet a set level of redemption requests – and work backwards to see what combination of factors would trigger that outcome. MFS is also working to improve the modelling of redemptions and to include more extreme scenarios in its stress-testing, he added.

Derwael was speaking at a webinar on liquidity risk management on June 25.

For Esma too, the Covid-19 crisis underscored the importance of its new rules, which come into force on September 30. Industry lobbyists had asked for a delay but the regulator declined the request. “No changes are foreseen with regards to the application date of the liquidity stress testing guidelines. Esma considers that it is of utmost importance, under current market circumstances, to ensure a timely application of these guidelines,” an Esma spokesperson told Risk.net earlier this month.

European funds suffered heavy redemptions in March, when the coronavirus outbreak set off a major liquidity crisis. Data from the European Fund and Asset Management Association shows that net outflows from Ucits funds totalled €313 billion ($352 billion), or nearly 3% of their net assets – matching the share lost at the height of the financial crisis in October 2008. At the same time, transaction costs and bid-ask spreads jumped for most asset classes.

“This pandemic resulted in a real liquidity crisis that was quite different from the credit crisis we experienced in 2008,” Svetlana Butvina, head of risk at BlackRock in Luxembourg, said at the webinar organised by the Association of the Luxembourg Funds Industry.

### Got that swing?

Fund managers had to use a variety of tools to manage liquidity and meet redemption requests in March. These tools should be firmly in place ahead of time, Derwael said, citing as an example swing pricing, an anti-dilution technique.

“So you probably have swing pricing, which I guess has become much more ubiquitous on the market. I think a lot of people have it in the prospectus but they don’t have it implemented in practice – I think that’s going to definitely go mainstream,” he said.

Swing pricing allows investment funds to adjust their exit price to reflect the cost of liquidating holdings to meet redemption requests. The practice, which is common among Ucits funds and has been permitted in the US since 2016, protects remaining investors from bearing the transaction costs incurred when others leave. Implementing it is not without complications, however.

Butvina at BlackRock, which used swing pricing during the Covid-19 crisis, said it is “critical” to incorporate market impact in swing factors because of a widening in bid-ask spreads and a decrease in market depth, especially in fixed income. “This caused a substantial increase in market impact produced by large trades and it obviously had to be reflected in factors,” she noted.

Stefan Junglen, a senior investment risk manager at DWS, said the process for determining swing factors should be established in normal times when liquidity costs are predictable.

“During a crisis, a review of swing factors can be required to be done on a daily basis based on what is actually happening on the day [of the redemption] and what the liquidity is on that day,” he added.

One recent innovation at BlackRock that proved “very useful” was a document describing available liquidity management tools and their application process, “with various details on a decision-making diagram on when and which tool to invoke, approval and governance process for each tool”, Butvina said.

She noted that a [circular](https://www.cssf.lu/wp-content/uploads/files/Lois_reglements/Circulaires/Hors_blanchiment_terrorisme/cssf19_733eng.pdf) released in December by Luxembourg’s financial regulator instructed Luxembourg Ucits funds to implement and periodically test contingency plans to ensure that liquidity management tools can be used “in a prompt and orderly manner”, including in stressed market conditions.

As for MFS, another lesson it has drawn from the market turmoil is the need to make its liquidity models “more reactive to market conditions”, Derwael said.

“You have some liquidity models that are purely based on volumes and you have other liquidity models that are based on volumes and costs of trading. And usually when you go beyond a given cost of trading, that security is supposed to be classified as illiquid.

“So that’s all fine, but when the market is moving to much less liquid terms – as we saw the whole market was moving – if you have a very low threshold for classifying it as illiquid, you will quickly be in trouble because all of your portfolio will be considered illiquid, whereas it’s the market that moved, it is not the portfolio as such,” he said, advising against having any static parameters in liquidity models.

While swing pricing, limits on redemptions and cash buffers can help manage outflows in the short term, over a longer period funds should consider using other tools in order to buy some time and avoid forced selling of assets, Derwael added.

Such tools include overdraft facilities, and committed and uncommitted credit lines, he said, giving an example: “It was not in Europe, but I know some of the depositories have come back and said, ‘Hey, we are not comfortable extending the overdraft facilities anymore, we want to cut them down’. So you need a credit line.”
