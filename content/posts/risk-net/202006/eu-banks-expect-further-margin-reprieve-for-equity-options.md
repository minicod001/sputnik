{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Exemptions for intra-group and equity options from non-cleared margin rules expire by January 2021_{{< /quote >}}

Banks are expecting EU regulators to further extend exemptions for equity options and intra-group trades from non-cleared margin rules on over-the-counter derivatives.

“I have heard positive noises in that direction,” says a regulatory expert at a European investment bank. “[I’m] watching this space carefully, but there does seem to be receptivity to fixing this issue.”

The global derivatives margin rules written by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (Iosco) require counterparties to post initial and variation margin against non-cleared trades. The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir), which brought those margin rules into EU law, granted firms a temporary grace period from posting collateral against single-stock options, index options and trades between two entities belonging to the same corporate group.

Emir’s exemptions were set to expire on January 4, 2020. However, the three European financial watchdogs – known collectively as the European Supervisory Authorities – amended the regulatory technical standard on non-cleared margin requirements in December last year, and extended the derogations to expire on January 4, 2021 for [equity options](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7207211/eu-to-grant-last-minute-margin-reprieve-for-equity-options) and December 21, 2020 for intra-group trades.

The ESAs recently published another amended version of the RTS on May 4 to incorporate [a delay to](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7529396/delay-to-im-calculation-window-leaves-some-exasperated) phases five and six of initial margin rules that was announced by the Basel Committee and Iosco on April 3. The amended RTS did not extend the exemptions for equity options and intra-group trades.

That amended RTS has not entered into EU law yet, and two bankers and an industry source say they expect the European Commission and the ESAs to further amend the regulatory technical standard before it becomes law, so as to extend the deadline for those exemptions.

“It will be in the new incarnation of the RTS that will be published imminently,” says a lawyer at a global investment bank.

An industry source says they expect the updated RTS to be published in the “coming weeks”, noting a further extension is necessary due to firms being put under strain by Covid-19. They point out that, even without the additional [complications](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7550641/blts-and-glitchy-wi-fi-lockdown-life-for-fx-execs) from coronavirus-related issues, the introduction of margin requirements for equity options and intra-group trades would have a big impact operationally and in terms of overall quantities of margin posted.

“The Commission is aware of the forthcoming expiration of deferred dates with regard to equity options and intra-group transactions in the margin RTS,” says an EC spokesperson. “We are currently reflecting on how best to address these deadlines together with the ESAs which are responsible for this technical standard.”

### The US connection

Sources aren’t sure how long the expected new exemption will last. The ESAs had previously only extended the exemptions for one year, as they didn’t want to leave a hole in their margin rules that would potentially expose firms to greater counterparty risk.

The ESAs have also stated they wanted to remain aligned with the globally agreed margin rules, which don’t allow an exemption for equity options, as well as jurisdictions that don’t provide an exemption, including Australia, Brazil and Japan.

Banks, however, argue the exemption for equity options should be made [permanent](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7236086/eu-gives-one-year-margin-reprieve-on-equity-options) because the same products are [permanent](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7236086/eu-gives-one-year-margin-reprieve-on-equity-options)ly exempt from margin rules in the US.

The trades are not in scope under US rules – outlined in Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act – as options on equities are classed as securities rather than swaps. In Dodd-Frank, non-cleared margin rules apply only to swap contracts.

The only way equity options could be included in Dodd-Frank’s non-cleared margin rules would be for the US Congress to bring them in scope, but lawmakers have not so far done this.

A letter sent to the EC and ESAs by several industry associations on April 30 states that if the derogation expires, then it would leave European firms at a competitive disadvantage to firms in jurisdictions that do not impose margin requirements on equity options.

The EU, along with other jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Switzerland, had originally [exempted equity options](https://www.risk.net/regulation/6802961/eu-banks-seek-last-minute-margin-reprieve-for-equity-options) so as to wait and see if the US would fix the hole in its rules.

Singapore also recently updated its guidelines on February 11, to permanently exempt equity options from margin rules.

### No more rollovers

According to the regulatory expert at the European investment bank, the EC and ESAs may have become more amenable to an exemption that lasts for longer than one year.

“I understand there’s an appetite to come up with something more robust than a one-year rollover,” they say.

Pauline Ashall, a partner at law firm Linklaters, says since the exemption for equity options is held within the RTS and not within the level one text, it is within the ESAs’ powers to make the exemption permanent.

“Any change to make the exemption permanent potentially applies only with respect to equity options,” says Ashall. “Making that exemption permanent could be done by amending the margin RTS, as that sets out all the details on what products are or are not in scope for margining.”

The EU’s exemption could be mimicked by regulators in Switzerland and Hong Kong, as both have been aligning their rules with the EU. After the ESAs published their first one-year extension to the derogation, regulators in both jurisdictions passed rules mimicking the EU’s extension.

The ESAs, however, will not be able to make the exemption for intra-group trades permanent, as the rule is laid down in primary legislation. The EC, Council of the EU and European Parliament would have to agree to amend Emir.

The level one text of Emir requires firms to post margin on intra-group derivatives exposures if they trade with a legal entity in a jurisdiction that the EC deems not to have equivalent margin rules to the EU.

In a separate letter sent to the EC and ESAs on April 30 by the same industry groups that penned the letter on equity options, the associations recommended extending the exemption for intra-group trades by three years. They also called for the EC to adopt more equivalence determinations. So far, the EC has only deemed Japan and the US to have equivalent margin rules.

If the changes made to the margin RTS enter into EU law before the end of this year, they will also apply in the UK. The UK left the EU on January 31, 2020, but has agreed that any amendments to EU legislation made before the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020 will be automatically inserted into UK legislation.

“Assuming the amending RTS is in force by the end of this year, the margin RTS as amended by it will automatically be onshored in the UK,” says Linklaters’ Ashall.
