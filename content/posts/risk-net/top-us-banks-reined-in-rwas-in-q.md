Systemic US banks’ risk-weighted assets (RWAs) fell by roughly 2% in aggregate over the three months to end-June, having leapt higher in the first quarter as the coronavirus crisis raged.

The total amount of RWAs used to the set the binding Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital requirements for each firm stood at $6.8 trillion at the end of Q2. Barring Goldman Sachs, binding RWAs fell at each global systemically important bank (G-Sib) over the quarter.

State Street’s fell the most percentage-wise, by 5% to $106.8 billion. Wells Fargo and Bank of America both saw their totals drop 4%, to $1.22 trillion and $1.5 trillion, respectively. JP Morgan’s sank 3% to $1.54 trillion, BNY Mellon’s 2% to $159.2 billion and Morgan Stanley’s by less than half a percent to $426.7 billion.

In contrast, Goldman Sachs’ binding RWAs, calculated using the advanced approaches, rose 2% over the quarter to $620 billion. But under the [standardised approach](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7655651/modelled-rwas-diverge-from-standardised-at-goldman-sachs), these fell 5% to $563 billion.

As of end-June, the G-Sibs bound by RWAs calculated using the standardised approach were JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and State Street. Bank of America, BNY Mellon, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were bound by advanced approaches RWAs.

### What is it? 
RWAs determine the minimum amount of risk-based capital that a bank must hold to meet regulatory requirements.

Top US banks must calculate their RWAs under both advanced approaches and the regulator-set standardised approach. That which produces the highest amount is used to set the binding CET1 capital requirement.

### Why it matters
Standardised and advanced RWAs don’t always move [in sync.](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7655651/modelled-rwas-diverge-from-standardised-at-goldman-sachs) Because the latter use banks’ own internal models, they react differently to changes in market values and credit conditions than the regulator-set formulas used to generate the former.

When the global economy nosedived in the first quarter with the onset of the coronavirus crisis, [advanced RWAs](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7566911/us-banks-face-capital-hit-from-resurgent-advanced-approaches) jumped higher and faster than standardised at a number of G-Sibs. At some firms they also fell back faster in the second quarter, likely reflecting a sharp decline in counterparty credit and credit valuation adjustment RWAs from the lofty levels reached in the explosive month of March.

Overall credit exposures also fell at some lenders over the three months to end-June. For example, JP Morgan’s chief financial officer said on a Q2 analysts’ call that the firm “opportunistically looked to reduce credit exposure” over this period. A number of lenders also saw revolving credit facilities, tapped in Q1, repaid over the last few months, reducing on-balance sheet exposures.

Policymakers are encouraging banks to support the US economy by maintaining lending, meaning executives are under pressure not to rein in exposures too much. However, top lenders also have to keep an eye on their risk-based capital levels. If these fall too close to minimum requirements, retrenchment may be unavoidable.
