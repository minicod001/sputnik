{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Only four former CROs are members of committees at 15 large banks, same total as 2012_{{< /quote >}}

An analysis of 15 large banks reveals only four have former chief risk officers (CROs) with large bank experience as external members of their board risk committees – the same number as in 2012, when Risk.net[undertook a study](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/2187658/jp-morgan-loss-highlights-lack-risk-experts-bank-committees) of committees at the same firms.

Risk.net’s updated study – which will be published online later this week – shows many of the committee members from 2012 are still there, and, while they bring impressive CVs, few have passed through the ranks of banks’ financial risk management divisions. That is despite a requirement from 2014 for US banks to appoint at least one external member with a background in risk management at large and complex financial institutions.

“While there has been some progress, there is still a struggle to have risk experts on risk committees,” says Marcelo Cruz, managing partner at risk consultancy Yacamy Advisors, and former CRO of mortgage service provider Ocwen.

Many banks have increased the size of their risk committees. All told, there are currently 82 members at the 15 banks, versus 75 in 2012. Three committees have the same chairman as they did in 2012: Frank Bramble at Bank of America; Anthony Santomero at Citi; and David Sidwell at UBS.

Frontline risk management experience among the committees appears to vary widely. Many boards have current and former senior executives from financial services, such as chief financial officers (CFOs) and CEOs, as well as ex-regulators. There are also a number of executives from non-financial industries, such as petroleum, technology, pharmaceuticals, consulting, publishing and defence.

Risk [governance](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/5376701/risk-culture-banks-fall-short-in-eyes-of-staff) is attracting greater regulatory scrutiny. The US Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential standards, in effect [since 2014](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20140218a.htm), stipulate risk committees should include “at least one risk management expert having experience in identifying, assessing and managing risk exposures of large, complex financial firms.”

Bank of America and JP Morgan have a former CRO or equivalent on their committees. Citi has Michael O’Neill, a former CFO of Bank of America. Goldman Sachs has David Viniar, its former CFO. Morgan Stanley has the former CEO of Wellington Management, an asset management firm, as its risk committee chairman. Wells Fargo has the former president of BNY Mellon as its risk committee chairman.

Regulators in other jurisdictions have similar requirements, but the language is somewhat softer than the Fed rule. The European Banking Authority, under [guidelines](https://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/1972987/Final+Guidelines+on+Internal+Governance+%28EBA-GL-2017-11%29.pdf) issued in 2017 implementing the European Union’s Capital Requirements Directive IV, requires that “members of the risk committee should have, individually and collectively, appropriate knowledge, skills and expertise concerning risk management and control practices”.

Similarly, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority [requires](https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/7/1.html) that “members of the risk committee must have appropriate knowledge, skills and expertise to fully understand and monitor the risk strategy and the risk appetite of the firm”.

One challenge to having more CROs serve on risk committees is the scarcity of candidates who are willing and able to serve on boards. Compared with other C-level executives, such as CFOs and chief operating officers, CROs are in relatively short supply, observers point out, because that title hasn’t existed as long. However, this doesn’t preclude having senior risk executives who have worked a rung below the CRO level. By relaxing the criteria slightly, the pool of available candidates could be greatly expanded.

“You don’t necessarily need CROs, but true risk professionals are the most desirable category,” says one former bank CRO. “The second category is front-line risk takers who understand the risk of the markets or of credit. There are hundreds of business heads and divisional risk managers. “
