> _The new field of experimental finance goes beyond backtesting_

Plenty of investment managers describe their approach to investing as scientific. In reality, that only goes so far. Scientists use experiments to prove their theories. In finance, quants build strategies, test them out-of-sample, and then peddle them to investors.

Backtests are equivalent to experiments that can be run only once. There’s no way to tell how a strategy would have fared had history unfolded differently, or even why it performs one way or another at different points in time.

Experimental finance, a relatively new branch of economics,  is taking investment ideas into the laboratory. The approach uses controlled simulation exercises to [understand investor behaviour](https://www.risk.net/investing/7649626/the-scientists-probing-the-human-mind-for-an-investing-edge).

In the lab, subjects are asked to play games of risk in a controlled environment. Often, these are simulations of trading in financial markets. Sometimes, the games are more abstract – staking money in repeated lotteries, say, or opening imaginary boxes that may contain cash or a ‘bomb’ that eliminates past gains. The researchers adjust prices and feed information to participants, monitoring how they react.

These experiments reveal things that empirical study cannot, says Domenico Massaro, assistant professor at the Catholic University of Milan. “When you go into the lab you are kind of like God. You control the whole environment.”

The experiments are run multiple times and can be used to pinpoint the forces that influence investor behaviour by holding other factors steady. “You see what might have happened – the impact of different policies, different trading mechanisms, whatever,” Massaro says. Real market data’s single run of history cannot provide such insights into “counterfactuals”. Only experiments can illuminate why investors choose not to trade, Massaro says.

The experimental approach is growing fast. Around 20 academics set up the Society for Experimental Finance in 2011. Now the group has almost 600 members.

An initiative among several universities in Europe to link virtual laboratories together may expand the scale at which online experiments can be carried out. Amazon Mechanical Turk – an internet-based service that recruits subjects to carry out simple tasks for money – also has proven a useful tool in conducting larger studies.

Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, chairman of Capital Fund Management, says experimental finance has much to offer. “We know a lot about ourselves,” he says.  “There are still people who believe we should be treated in models as rational agents. We know that we tend to be influenced by what other people are thinking. We’re influenced by what happened in the past. We tend to be conservative in our views when faced with new information. We tend to lag in response to updates. These are things you can test.”

Professional investors might be expected not to exhibit such errors. But the research says they probably will.

An analysis of 267 mutual funds in Europe cross-checked with lab work on the fund manager’s risk appetite found a clear correlation between risk tolerance in the lab and the riskiness of funds versus their benchmarks.

Data from foreign exchange traders shows when they hit loss limits in a foreign exchange trade, they often double down rather than cutting their losses. In a simulation, one academic told participants hanging on to losing stocks was an error. They did it anyway.

The experimental method has the potential to reach a deeper understanding of these quirks of behaviour. As the lab work continues, quants will surely want to keep tabs on what they find.
