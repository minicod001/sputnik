Risk-weighted assets at Deutsche Bank’s holding pen for unwanted assets – the capital release unit (CRU) – dropped €1.6 billion ($1.9 billion) over the three months to end-June, boosting the group’s capital ratio by 13 basis points.

RWAs at the CRU amounted to  €42.5 billion at end-June, down 4% on Q1 and 7% on end-2019.

RWAs linked to credit risk and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) fell sharpest over the first half of the year, offsetting increases to those tied to market risk.

The leverage exposure of the ‘bad bank’ dropped even faster than RWAs, by 13% over the three months to end-June and 20% since the turn of the year, to €101.8 billion.

These savings defied an increase in the value of assets tied to the CRU, which rose 2% to €265.3 billion over the first half

In contrast to the CRU, risk and leverage exposures climbed at Deutsche’s other business units. The core bank, excluding the CRU, saw RWAs jump 4% and leverage exposure increase 5% over the first half, though the end-June totals were lower than those at end-March.

Cuts to the ‘band bank’ helped lift Deutsche’s group-wide Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, which increased an overall 42 basis points to 13.3% over the first half.

### Who said what

“Our transformation was built around five key decisions. First, to exit businesses where we did not have a market-leading position by setting up a dedicated capital release unit. We have exited equities trading. We are in the process of transferring our prime finance operations and reduced assets in the capital release unit by over €100 billion since 2018,” – Christian Sewing, chief executive officer at Deutsche Bank.

### What is it?

Deutsche Bank announced a [plan of action](https://www.db.com/newsroom_news/2019/deutsche-bank-announces-radical-transformation-en-11538.htm) in 2019, to reduce costs by a quarter and hit a return on tangible equity of 8% by 2022. It is also targeting a leverage ratio of 4.5% by 2020 and 5% in 2022, as well as a CET1 capital ratio of 12.5%.

One plank of the strategy is to unwind non-core assets in a newly formed CRU that the bank plans to shutter by 2022.

### Why it matters

In an interview with Risk.net, Deutsche’s chief risk officer, [Stuart Lewis,](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7654716/stuart-lewis-deutsches-survivor-confronts-covid-19) said the uncertainty unleashed by the coronavirus crisis should not delay the bank’s plan to wind-down the CRU by 2022.

However, the pace of cuts did slow in Q1 as the bank took the time to evaluate the derivatives portfolio locked up in the unit. The market turmoil of March and April would also have deterred potential bidders for CRU assets, who would have struggled to value them effectively given the unprecedented levels of volatility. Lewis says now that some amount of normalcy has returned, the bank is looking “to put some deals together.”

In the event of future sales, CRU exposures would fall not only through the sloughing off of credit and market exposures, but also because it would be off the hook for operational risk exposures, too. Op RWAs made up 61% of the unit’s total at end-June.
