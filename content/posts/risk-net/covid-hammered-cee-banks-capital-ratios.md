Banks in Slovenia and Romania saw their solvency ratios drop the furthest of European Union lenders over the first three months of the year, when the coronavirus crisis first swept the continent.

Data from the [European Banking Authority (EBA)](https://eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/risk-dashboard), covering 182 lenders, shows that Slovenian firms’ weighted average Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratios fell 440 basis points to 14.3% over Q1, and Romanian banks’ 190bp to 16.9%. The Tier 1 leverage ratios of the banking systems in each country also fell, by 210bp in Slovakia and 90bp in Romania.

The weighed average CET1 ratio across the EU was 14.4%, down from 14.9% in Q4 2019. The EBA said that the deterioration reflected the sharp economic downturn triggered by the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to a sudden jump in risk-weighted assets (RWAs), which make up banks’ CET1 ratio denominators.

However, banks in 10 EU countries either saw no change to their CET1 ratios, or posted quarter-on-quarter increases: Ireland, Bulgaria, Italy, Denmark, Slovakia, Luxembourg, Estonia, Czechia, Latvia and Lithuania.

Banks in Estonia had the highest average CET1 ratio in Europe, at 26.9%, and those in Spain the lowest, at 11.5%.

Firms at the 25th percentile of the distribution had a CET1 ratio of 13% in Q1, down from 13.4% in Q4 2019. Those at the 75th percentile experienced a sharper drop, to 18.7% from 19.5%.

### What is it?

The EBA publishes a [Risk Dashboard](https://eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/risk-dashboard) each quarter, with data on European banks’ solvency, credit risk and asset quality, profitability, balance sheet structure and liquidity. The figures are based on a sample of 182 banks.

### Why it matters

EU banks’ own funds took a wallop when the coronavirus crisis first hit, but it’s likely the data for Q2 will show their capital positions recovering, and then some.

This is because of the extraordinary measures taken by policymakers to ensure lenders could continue to extend credit even as the economy went into a pandemic-induced tailspin.

As demonstrated by [Santander](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7660686/coronavirus-crisis-sours-eu8bn-of-santanders-loans) and [Barclays](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7660621/relief-for-credit-losses-buoys-barclays-capital-ratio), these helped CET1 ratios to rebound, especially the emergency fix allowing banks to [‘add back’](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d498.pdf) 100% of loan-loss provisions incurred on performing exposures into capital.

However, if the coronavirus recession [deepens](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7660071/severe-covid-recession-could-topple-some-eu-banks), bank loan portfolios could start defaulting, leading to a rapid depletion of capital no matter the temporary relief measures. This may push some lenders into distress, and force supervisory action.
