{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Environmental and social behaviour predicts credit ratings in North America – less so in Europe_{{< /quote >}}

Being a good corporate citizen can be a good sign of a company’s creditworthiness – but it depends which country it’s in, according to a new study.

Gregor Dorfleitner and Johannes Grebler, at Germany’s Regensburg University, and Sebastian Utz, at St Gallen in Switzerland, are the latest researchers to look at the link between financial strength and factors such as pollution reduction, social concern and others, under the heading of corporate social and environmental (CSE) performance.

In a paper due to be published in the [Journal of Risk](https://www.risk.net/journal-of-risk) later this year, they use credit rating information from Standard & Poor’s on North American and European companies, and the Thomson Reuters Asset4 sustainability rating, to show that elements of CSE can explain and predict credit ratings – but only in certain countries.

North American companies with higher environmental and social ratings had higher credit ratings as well. A lower impact on their surroundings, and greater trust from workers, customers and society, was associated with lower default risk. The sample covered 2003 to 2017, and was split into a training sample from 2003 to 2013 and an out-of-sample test set from 2014 to 2017. Good CSE performance in the first period tended to predict good credit ratings in the test.

But for European companies, the picture was different. Environmental impact was irrelevant to credit rating. Only the social element of the Asset4 rating – which tracks “employment quality, health and safety, training and development, diversity and opportunities, human rights, community and product responsibility”, according to Thomson Reuters – had any value in explaining credit ratings. Environmental concerns were irrelevant.

[Earlier research](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2015/11/05/good-corporate-social-performance-may-lead-to-higher-credit-ratings/), they point out, had shown a link between CSE and credit ratings in Europe, but only when the analysis was at a national level – a company that improves its CSE rating, operating in a country that also has a good environmental and social record, will see an improvement in credit rating. But a company that does the same in a lower-rated country will not. The low national rating reflects that good company-level CSE is not valued – and, therefore, not rewarded – in that society.

Something similar is at work here, suggest Dorfleitner and his co-authors. Ironically, it’s the relatively high political salience of environmental issues in Europe that makes environmental sensitivity less of a differentiating factor for European companies. A relative lack of local resources forces European manufacturers to be less wasteful – national and European Union-level laws compel them to reduce emissions and other pollution. The result is European companies are all more or less forced to have high environmental scores. By contrast, the authors write, “firms in North America have a higher degree of freedom to differentiate themselves from their peers regarding environmental issues” – making environmental performance a useful indicator of creditworthiness for them, but not for their peers in Europe.

Social performance, meanwhile, works well to explain ratings in both North America and Europe, but has much better predictive power in North America. Again, the authors suggest, this reflects cultural and legal differences. North America has lower social spending and a less regulated labour market – meaning, again, that North American companies have more room to differentiate themselves from each other. And companies that choose to have higher social standards than necessary will outperform their rivals in financial terms as a result. They note that European companies have less varied social scores, and that the variation is actually declining over time – potentially explaining its lack of predictive power in Europe, as standards are compelled to converge by changes in regulation.

“These figures reflect that European firms increasingly resemble each other in the out-of-sample period with respect to their social performance,” comments Grebler.

“Hence, increased social performance is no longer an opportunity for firms to differentiate [themselves] from their peers. Finally, increases of prediction quality through social performance appear plausibly insignificant.”

It’s possible there is no direct link between CSE scores and creditworthiness – instead, a good CSE score could be a sign of a healthy (and financially advantageous) corporate culture in other ways, rather than representing a lower risk of losses due specifically to CSE factors.

“We do not prove causality, but rather correlation,” says Dorfleitner. “So, the [score] might be considered to be a signal – however, [it is] one that a bank can make use of for prediction.”
