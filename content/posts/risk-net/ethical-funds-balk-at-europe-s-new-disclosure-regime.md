{{< quote 4682b4 >}}_Proposals for 32 reporting criteria are “unmanageable”, complain asset managers_{{< /quote >}}

Any asset manager worth their salt offers ethical products focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. But does the manager screen these investments against threats to endangered species of wildlife? Or do they monitor how much untreated waste water is discharged by companies in their ethical range of funds?

Unlikely.

However, a new law will force all European investment firms to do just that from March next year. The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) requires regulated entities – any investment firm with operations in a European Union country – to provide a host of disclosures on investments marketed as ESG.

The purpose of the SFDR is to improve standards in sustainable investment and combat so-called greenwashing, the practice of luring buyers with marketing for investments that turn out to be less than ethical.

Asset managers, pension funds and other investment firms in the EU will need to publish information on a wide range of activities by companies within their portfolio of ESG products. European lawmakers have proposed a total of 32 separate reporting criteria in a [consultation](https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/joint-esa-consultation-esg-disclosures) exercise due to close on September 1.

Some of the planned disclosures are easy enough to obtain: the gender composition of a company’s board, for example. But investment firms complain that a big chunk of the required data is unduly obscure and will be nearly impossible to report accurately.

“In many cases, the proposed criteria are close to what we’re already making use of. But some of these 32 are not manageable by any asset manager company – at least in a reasonable and sound manner,” says Stéphane Janin, head of global regulatory development at Axa Investment Managers.

One expert reckons firms will struggle to meet at least one-third of the criteria.

The EU is also revising a parallel piece of legislation on corporate disclosure, the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). Industry parties are urging lawmakers to align the two regimes, to ease the reporting burden for investment firms.

Pressure is also mounting to delay the introduction of the SFDR, particularly given the disruption to business from the coronavirus pandemic.

“Even prior to Covid-19, the timetable set by the European Commission (EC) was quite tight. If we look at several other European directives and regulations – including, most recently, Mifid II – the implementation timeline for those directives had to be delayed because the regulatory technical standards weren’t ready in time,” says Peter Stapleton, a partner and head of funds and investment management advisory at law firm Maples and Calder.

Besides the 32 criteria for individual investments, firms will also need to publish a raft of business information including: policies on sustainability risk; how these risks affect likely returns; and, if a particular investment is linked to an index, how the index aligns with the investor’s sustainability objectives.

No wonder Europe’s markets regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma), has described the new rules as a “more maximalist approach to disclosures”.

For many firms, creating the apparatus to make the disclosures will involve highly technical and challenging work, market participants say.

“Investment managers who are new to ESG will have to build teams of internal experts who will be able to apply the relatively complex criteria set out in the taxonomy regulation and screen underlying investments,” says Stapleton.

The new law will apply to companies offering investment products inside the EU. But the disclosure obligations encompass any activities of an investee company “regardless of their location”, an EC document states.

This means asset managers may have to source information from jurisdictions outside of the EU with different policies on financial reporting and sustainability. Finding out the carbon emissions of a large publicly listed company in France is one matter; sourcing sustainability data from a small, privately owned hydro company in Latin America is another.

Observers suggest that asset managers may come to rely on data from specialist third-party providers to help ease the reporting burden, even if that data comes at a price.

The head of the Alternative Investment Management Association’s (Aima) Brussels office, Marie-Adelaide de Nicolay, says many of the group’s members are uncertain about where they should find some of the information required.

“For now, many of these indicators are simply not readily available,” says de Nicolay.

### Imperfect harmony

Revisions to the parallel NFRD regime are now under way. The rules require large companies to report policies on environmental protection, human rights, social responsibility, money laundering, and more.

Experts point out that if the finalised NFRD does not include, for example, an instruction telling companies to report how much waste water they discharge, investment managers within the scope of the SFDR will naturally have trouble finding that information.

“The hope is that there will be alignment between what is required of financial market participants by the SFDR’s regulatory technical standards and what will be required in the new, revised NFRD,” says de Nicolay.

Regulators are aware of the dangers of a potential mismatch. Europe’s three supervisory authorities, including Esma, sent a [joint letter](https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/2020_06_11_letter_to_evp_dombrovskis_from_esas_chairs_re_nfrd_consultation.pdf) to the EC in June requesting corrective action. The letter detailed the adjustments they would like to see to the NFRD, highlighting the “absence of mandatory requirements” in the current text of the directive and urging the EC to consider the need for the two packages to match up.

A revised NFRD that lacks mandatory requirements identical to or more exhaustive than the 32 criteria in the SFDR, the letter suggested, would imperil the bloc’s sustainable finance legislation. The three authorities urged the EC to involve them closely in the revision process.

Esma did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.

If alignment isn’t achieved, Axa’s Janin says, the implementation of the SFDR must take the likely data limitations into account, either in its scope or content. While he says the EC is aware of the data issues firms would experience as a result of any mismatch between the two regimes, he doesn’t think the revision of the NFRD will be made before the SFDR takes effect in March 2021.

“To be realistic, any revision of the NFRD will not be implemented in practice for at least three years,” says Janin.

The EC’s proposals for revising the NFRD are not due to conclude until early next year – then, the European Parliament and Council need to make their amendments, which will take another year, Janin explains. Finally, another year will be spent on implementation.

Janin believes it would make sense to delay the activation of the SFDR until this work has been completed.

But because the SFDR is one component of the EC’s ‘Green Deal’ – a mammoth cluster of policies and laws designed to make Europe carbon-neutral by 2050 – commentators say there is limited political appetite for delays to any of its constituent parts.

### Time is ticking

Delays to elements of the SFDR have already taken place as a result of coronavirus, though. Some of the guidelines, for instance, which managers will need to understand in order to draft the required disclosures, won’t be ready until the end of this year.

The hold-up would cause problems for firms creating mandatory templates for disclosure. The EC wants a degree of harmonisation on disclosures that would allow investors to make like-for-like comparisons when examining products. The EC has recommended that the three European supervisory authorities develop the mandatory templates in tandem to ensure common standards across Europe.

As noted in the consultation paper, these templates aren’t ready, and the supervisors aim to publish them in the third or fourth quarter this year. If the guidelines arrive towards the end of the window – that is, at year-end – firms within their scope would be left with just three months to finish the templates.

“It’s a short timetable for managers to adapt, update their documentation and their internal processes,” says Maples and Calder’s Stapleton.

Firms could begin mandatory template-related efforts now based on the information that is available, he adds. But they risk the prospect of redoing legal work if their predictions don’t match up with the eventual conclusions of the European supervisors.

Janin says Axa supports the aims of the regulation, but he says regulators must be “realistic” in their approach. He acknowledges that a delay may not be granted, however, because of the breadth of support for the Green Deal in the EU, no matter how hard the European supervisory authorities push.

It’s unclear how regulators will treat non-compliant firms, says Ken Rivlin, a partner and head of the global environmental law group at Allen & Overy. He argues that penalties may not be common because of the public-shaming aspect implicit in the regulation. The market at large will have access to all disclosures, he says, and a firm that improperly labels investments as ‘green’ may develop a bad reputation.

“If a competitor sees that a particular entity is making claims that they don’t agree with, I’d expect them to make that clear,” says Rivlin. “The information will be out in the public domain, and the market will assess it and make judgements based on that.”

While industry commentators share a number of concerns on the challenges of the SFDR, there is a divergence of opinion when it comes to which firms will have the most trouble complying with the new rules.

Some argue that bigger firms with plenty of resources and manpower will cope reasonably well, as they’ll be able to dedicate large numbers of staff to deal with the workload. But bigger firms may have millions of underlying investments that will need to be looked at, which present “enormous” operational costs, says Aima’s de Nicolay.

Axa’s Janin says medium-sized or smaller “generalist” asset managers that don’t have a specific ESG focus may run into difficulty as the regulation is implemented. Such entities, he says, lack both means and expertise. While small boutique investors are also low on means, he adds, many have an explicit ESG focus and a detailed understanding of sustainable investment.

Allen & Overy’s Rivlin argues that smaller firms will struggle the most, largely due to the cost of compliance.

De Nicolay says: “Blanket regulation like this always hits smaller companies pretty hard, but some smaller firms have been very active on this topic already – we’ve seen some that are very agile.”
