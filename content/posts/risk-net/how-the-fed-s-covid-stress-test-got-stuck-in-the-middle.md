> _Experts fear CCAR add-on has neither informed investors nor guided capital management_

What’s the purpose of a bank stress test? That might sound like an overly philosophical question in the middle of a global pandemic, but it’s the question that market participants, together with former and some current regulators, have ended up asking after the results of this year’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) were published in the US on June 25.

The original US public stress test in 2009 – the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) – was intended to identify just how big a hole the subprime crisis had left in banks’ capital ratios, as part of the process of rebuilding the banking system.

“One goal was to provide information, transparency and market discipline. But another goal was to restore and maintain public confidence in the financial system,” said Randal Quarles, the Federal Reserve’s vice-chair for supervision, referring to the SCAP in a CCAR curtain-raiser speech on June 19, 2020.

Subsequently, CCAR developed into a [countercyclical](https://www.risk.net/regulation/6805321/double-jeopardy-ccar-and-the-countercyclical-buffer) supervisory tool. During the good times, the Fed calculated how much damage banks might suffer in the bad times, and set capital requirements accordingly, to ensure there would be no need to repeat the 2008–2009 government interventions.

And when the bad times arrive – and turn out to be worse than the most recent CCAR scenario – what then?

The Fed had unveiled CCAR scenarios for this year in February. By early April, unemployment rates were already blasting through the 10% level that the three-year stress scenario had projected as the peak in the third quarter of 2021.

There are good reasons for regulators to use some form of [scenario analysis](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7511401/as-covid-snaps-credit-models-lenders-turn-to-stress-testing) to get a handle on the damage the coronavirus itself might cause, and to decide if banks need to take any pre-emptive actions to manage the impact.

Both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are carrying out what they refer to as desktop exercises – similar to the Fed’s top-down CCAR – running reported bank data through possible scenarios for the effects of Covid-19. However, recognising the [great uncertainty](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7552516/covid-scenarios-finding-the-worst-worst-case) around potential credit losses, European regulators also took the precaution of telling banks to [suspend](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7522861/fed-missed-chance-to-curb-dividends-say-ex-supervisors) dividends, at least during 2020, until the situation is clearer.

In a similar vein, the Fed chose to carry out a set of top-down [sensitivity analyses](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7564706/banks-braced-for-mystery-coronavirus-add-on-to-ccar) alongside CCAR, based on three possible scenarios for the coronavirus economic downturn and recovery. But even after the results of this coronavirus add-on were published on June 25, the Fed has stopped short of suspending dividend payments altogether for the whole sector.

It’s an outcome that has left confusion and concern in its wake.

“I doubt any dividend payments will scuttle any large US bank, but the Fed has now positioned itself to take the fall should any of them tremble under continuing macroeconomic stress or market fragility,” says Karen Petrou, managing partner at consultancy Federal Financial Analytics. “In 2008, the banking crisis was the banks’ fault; this time, folks will say it’s the Fed’s.”

She warns that the Fed’s handling of this year’s stress test “may have lost all the critical credibility it gained when the 2009 exercise rescued the banking system”.

And while bank lobby groups had argued against a blanket suspension of dividends, some of the bankers themselves are unsure what to make of the Covid add-on, and still less sure of what happens next.

“The release of last week’s results was not really well telegraphed and a little confusing, causing more market reaction than it should have. We would prefer a process that is smooth and predictable,” says one industry source.

A stress test manager at the US subsidiary of a large foreign bank says the sensitivity analyses were useful for “reminding” banks of the risks coronavirus poses for capital management. But his personal reaction to the add-on is, if anything, tougher than that of the regulator so far: “Paying dividends while [facing] significantly increased loan loss provisioning and uncertain recovery times is not an advisable approach for any bank.”

Hence the Fed may have ended up with a coronavirus stress test that neither reassures investors that banks are ready to face the fallout from the crisis, nor provides banks with much guidance on the right approach to managing capital in the difficult months to come.

This is not the end of the story. The Fed says it will continue to monitor the situation and maintain a dialogue with banks about capital distributions. But that just makes it more important to understand what the June 25 stress test add-on achieved – and what it didn’t.

### Saving the SCB

If prudential stress testing in ordinary times is akin to a fire drill, then there’s a risk that stress testing during an economic crisis of such magnitude ends up being like trying to fight an actual blaze and carry out a fire drill at the same time.

That, at least, seems to be the thinking in Europe, where the BoE and European Banking Authority both suspended stress tests for this year. But the Fed had chosen this year to integrate CCAR into the pillar one capital framework for large banks, through its new [stress capital buffer](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7501576/the-feds-stress-capital-buffer-relaxed-but-not-relaxing) (SCB). The peak capital depletion in CCAR is used to set the SCB, which in turn dictates the dividend payments banks can make from October 1, 2020.

Rather than postponing both CCAR and the introduction of the SCB, the Fed chose to [push ahead](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7512191/fed-defies-coronavirus-to-push-ahead-with-stress-test) with the existing schedule. This prompted an accusation from former Fed governor Daniel Tarullo that his successors were in danger of prioritising process over purpose.

“The confusing announcement of this year’s CCAR results reflects the awkwardness of an agency trying to take account of an unexpected development without departing too much from established procedures,” Tarullo wrote in a [post](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/06/25/stress-testing/) for the Brookings Institution on June 25. “The stress testing regime that is emerging appears little more than a compliance exercise.”

By committing to the CCAR calendar in the maiden year of the SCB, which would mean using submissions due on April 6, the Fed had no choice but to stick with the pre-Covid scenarios applied to a static balance sheet from December 31, 2019.

However, the rapid deterioration of economic outlook from mid-March meant the test would be incomplete without the additional sensitivity analyses based on current conditions. The analyses used three different scenarios, namely V-shaped (rapid), U-shaped (slower) and W-shaped (double-dip) economic recoveries. The V-shaped scenario had a similar impact to the main CCAR severely adverse scenario.

The problem was how to carve up capital policy between the main CCAR and the coronavirus add-on.

The original CCAR is established through the Fed’s rulemaking as the formal route to provide banks with their [individual SCB](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7649206/three-us-banks-face-stress-capital-buffer-add-ons) and capital distribution permissions, based on their performance in the test.

But the results for the Covid-19 sensitivity analyses were far worse than for CCAR (see figure 1). That obliged the Fed to take action beyond the introduction of the SCB, or risk losing its credibility.

“Sticking with an obviously stale scenario during an actual economic shock undermines the very purpose of stress testing,” Tarullo noted in his post.

### More important, less transparent

Hence the add-on became more important than the main CCAR. But it was also less transparent. Results showing capital depletion in aggregate and for the 25th and 75th percentiles were published, but the impact on each individual bank was not revealed to the public.

Quarles explained the limited disclosure in his speech on June 19, saying it partly reflected the hurried and improvised nature of the analysis: “We chose rough approximations of economic paths rather than detailed scenarios, which means that the usual set of detailed variable data that we use will not be available.”

Still, Petrou points to the stark contrast with the SCAP, where full transparency was intended specifically to give investors a clearer understanding of each bank’s capital position.

“The Fed’s reluctance to provide more than general data about big-bank vulnerability may support bank share prices, such as they are, but truth might do the same or even better,” says Petrou. “If investors knew the truth and it isn’t all that awful, they might be willing to give banks still more capital firepower that would then promote economic growth.”

Perhaps more surprising, the Fed declined to share individual results with the banks themselves, making it difficult for firms to incorporate the analyses into their own capital planning.

A statement from Quarles accompanying the publication of the results emphasised the general aims of the sensitivity analyses – to gauge the performance of the banking system and inform ongoing supervision – which could be achieved without disclosing individual results.

Nonetheless, the decision not to disclose results to the firms themselves surprised William Lang, managing director at Promontory Financial Group and former bank supervisor.

“It would be odd for the Fed not to discuss individual results with individual institutions,” Lang says. “You would normally present results to the relevant institutions individually and review them in light of the institution’s own analysis, and that would serve as a basis for discussions.”

The industry source agrees, saying: “It would have been better if the Fed shared the sensitivity analysis results with each firm as part of the supervisory process, given acknowledged issues with the data, assumptions and models.”

Petrou adds that banks can be [too optimistic](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7649101/us-banks-lowball-loan-pain-overstate-trading-hit-in-fed-tests) about their own performance in stress tests, as demonstrated when their bottom-up results are compared with the top-down outputs generated by the Fed. Some may be able to deduce from the aggregated results for the coronavirus add-on where they lie on the distribution of outcomes and respond accordingly, but there’s no guarantee of that.

“I think you're going to see more banks than not assuming that they’re at least in the second quartile, if not best in class,” Petrou says.

Risk.net understands that the decision not to share individual results with banks was in line with standard Fed policy. The regulator had used the stress test framework as a methodological starting point for the sensitivity analysis, and it therefore applied its information parity policy to the sensitivity results, which meant the public and the banks would receive the same information.

### Divided on dividends

The low level of disclosure matters, because the Fed has made concrete decisions about capital policy based on the coronavirus add-on. It has instructed banks to suspend share buybacks – which constituted around 70% of all capital distribution in recent years – and cap third-quarter dividends at the same level as the second quarter, provided this does not exceed net average quarterly income for the previous four quarters.

The regulator also allowed itself further wiggle-room to restrict dividend payments by individual banks, by adding “unless otherwise specified” to the statement.

Jeremy Kress, assistant professor of business law at the University of Michigan and a former Fed lawyer, suggests the coronavirus analyses “enabled the Fed to use facially neutral criteria to restrict certain banks’ dividends without having to name them and without implementing a blanket restriction”.

A senior Fed official says the sensitivity analyses may not be entirely reflective of reality, but they provided additional information that is highly valuable in a time of unprecedented uncertainty.

Clearly, basing Fed dividend policy on more rather than less analysis makes sense. However, critics argue the Fed did not even make full use of all the information available.

For example, the sensitivity analyses used end-2019 balance sheets as the starting point, with “targeted adjustments to account for the most material changes to banks’ balance sheets in the first quarter related to the Covid event, such as sizeable credit-line drawdowns by corporations”, Quarles explained.

But what of capital distributions made or planned since the start of 2020? In a [statement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/brainard-statement-20200625c.htm) accompanying the stress test results, Fed governor Lael Brainard referred to the decision to cap dividends for the third quarter at average net quarterly income over the previous four quarters, and noted: “That past net income and more was already paid out in the prior quarters.”

The Fed’s analyses found “several” undisclosed banks would approach minimum capital levels under U- and W- shaped recovery scenarios, with estimated loan losses of $700 billion. The Fed also disclosed that incorporating planned and actual 2020 capital distributions to date would have lowered the aggregate capital ratios by 50 basis points.

What the regulator did not show was the impact of 2020 payouts for individual banks, or even for the 25th and 75th percentiles. Brainard noted in her statement that the capital ratio under the W-shaped scenario for the 25th percentile was just 4.8%, only 30 basis points above the 4.5% minimum (see figure 1) – and without taking into account 2020 capital distributions to date.

There is no way of knowing whether the impact of capital distributions on the 25th percentile would have been more or less than the aggregate 50bp, but Brainard criticised the board’s majority decision not to suspend bank dividends immediately.

“The truth is that, taking into account completed and planned capital distributions, some portion of the banking sector would fall below minimum capital requirements [in the sensitivity analyses],” says Kress. “It would have been indefensible for the Fed to continue allowing dividend payments if it had accurately reported bank capital levels that reflected the effect of those dividends.”

### Worse luck next time?

Still, the size of dividend payments for the rest of 2020 is far from settled. The Fed is providing banks with updated scenarios for Covid-19, and they will be required to resubmit capital plans using those scenarios 45 days later.

“The requested re-run, once Fed instructions are clear, will give us a better picture of the full impact of new scenarios on bank capital and dividend payment prospects,” says the stress test manager at the foreign bank subsidiary.

Moreover, the Fed announced it will “conduct additional stress analyses later this year as data from banks become available and economic conditions evolve”.

That leaves plenty of uncertainty. A senior Fed official says they have not yet decided the exact timing for firms to resubmit their capital plans, whether these plans will be based on sensitivity analyses or a fuller round of stress testing, whether the results of any fresh stress tests will be made public, and whether they will feed directly into an updated SCB

This work is unlikely to be completed in time for an official policy change on third quarter dividends. But the shadow of further stress testing and some as-yet unidentified follow-up from the Fed is likely to make banks “very parsimonious” with their dividend projections, Petrou believes.

“The fewer promises banks make about payouts, the lower the odds of a surprise. Surprises could be costly to the markets now and therefore to the financial system, and this is not a good time to be surprised by anything,” she says.

Lang shares this interpretation, suggesting the Fed has used “moral suasion” to restrict dividend payments for the rest of 2020, rather than enforcing a suspension. But it is too early to say whether that approach turns out to be a way to keep the regulator and banks on the same page on capital management, or whether it will ultimately undershoot what was needed.

“I wouldn’t say that moral suasion has no impact, but certainly a case could be made – as governor Brainard has – for a restriction until it is clear that the capital hit will not be overly severe,” says Lang.
