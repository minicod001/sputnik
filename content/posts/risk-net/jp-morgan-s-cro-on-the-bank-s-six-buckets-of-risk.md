> _Risk30: From loan losses to electromagnetic pulses, JPMorgan Chase has a place for it_

This is the last of 10 interviews marking Risk’s 30th anniversary. Links to the rest of the series can be found [here](https://www.risk.net/our-take/5353481/the-future-of-risk-in-10-interviews-volatility-liquidity-and-tech).

There are lots of things Ashley Bacon doesn’t want to talk about.

During the course of the interview, he declines to comment – or refuses to expand on a point – on nine separate occasions. Bacon explains that he needs to be cautious – which, as chief risk officer (CRO) of JPMorgan Chase, is probably part of the job description.

When he does speak, it’s worth listening. Like [his boss](https://www.risk.net/our-take/4666686/nickel-and-dimon-why-bank-ceos-loathe-op-risk-capital), Jamie Dimon, he has strong views on operational risk capital. Op risk exposures count for more than a quarter of the bank’s $1.46 trillion in risk-weighted assets, but Bacon points out that some of this comes from discontinued businesses or past missteps.

(One of the things Bacon doesn’t want to talk about is the bank’s most famous [recent misstep](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/market-risk/2255070/jp-morgan-manipulated-var-and-crm-models-at-london-whale-unit-senate-report) – the 2012 ‘London Whale’ credit trading losses he played a big part in resolving, a year before his promotion to the CRO’s job).

He also has concerns about new loan-loss accounting rules – their “intuitively appealing” focus on [lifetime credit risk](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5189526/volatility-of-ifrs-9-loss-estimates-alarms-lenders) raises awkward questions about the treatment of products such as credit cards, he says. And he believes the basic profile of market risk is changing, with liquidity increasingly likely to be bimodal – abundant in good times and absent in bad – which could magnify future stresses.

But for risk management geeks, one of the most interesting features of the interview is that when describing the bank’s approach to the segmentation of emerging exposures, Bacon barely mentions market, credit and operational risk at all. All three are wrapped up in some way, of course, but it has an unusual way of dealing with the sources of its exposure, separating them into six buckets.

“We find it helpful to have a framework into which you can put emerging risks because there are just so many. We try to think about them in six different, non-overlapping explanatory categories, and they have very different dynamics around each of them,” he says.

Into the first goes everything caused by “adverse economic conditions” – from interest rate sensitivity to loan losses. Banks are in business to take precisely this kind of exposure, Bacon says, so the aim is to make sure JP Morgan has the right amount.

Bucket two covers deliberate [wrongdoing](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5348721/citi-overhauls-bonus-system-to-strengthen-conduct-culture) by the bank’s employees or its suppliers. This is where you would find Libor or foreign exchange rate manipulation, rogue trading, deliberate mis-selling, sanctions-busting or a host of other horrors. As a group, these are “very topical and potentially very, very dangerous,” Bacon says.

The third category is for mistakes – process failures or errors of judgement, rather than anything malicious.

The fourth reflects JP Morgan’s exposure to regulatory, political or social forces outside its control – from a gold-plated leverage ratio to deglobalisation and trade wars. By definition, these are tough risks for a bank to manage, Bacon notes: “All you can do really is contribute to the public debate in a credible way.”

Category five catches the risk of market dysfunction, but to remain distinct from category one, it only applies to markets that have gone [temporarily mad](https://www.risk.net/regulation/2397594/tucker-regulators-knew-reforms-might-create-bumpy-markets) – not those that have broken down under the stress of a financial crisis. “You could think about a flash crash or unusual liquidity flows. Crucially here, it would not be driven by economics – rather markets that are moving fast in an irrational and dysfunctional manner,” he says.

Finally, the sixth bucket contains natural and man-made disasters, ranging from the obvious – such as tsunamis or tornadoes – to the exotic, such as electromagnetic pulses.

In essence, traditional market and credit risk all goes into the first of these categories, with the biggest sources of op risk taking up the next two. Categories four and five are widely acknowledged as a challenge for banks, but are rarely seen as a risk management responsibility.

To be clear, the bank does also look at risk in terms of manifestation – market, credit and operational – but Bacon says it’s helpful to think about the cause as well. The point, he argues, is that each of the categories has its own distinct set of drivers, and focusing on where the risk comes from makes it easier for the bank to think about its defences.

“What matters with all of this analysis is the ‘so what?’ question,” says Bacon. “It makes you focus on the various programmes of ongoing enhancement around the company, and how they map onto risks we identify as most concerning based on the impact or probability.”

Impact has to be considered for each category separately and can’t be reduced to the size of any immediate financial hit, he adds – a hefty loss that results from the actions of a rogue trader would be perceived in “a completely different way” to one that was caused by a credit downturn.

So, how does the bank turn thought into action? Bacon declines to spell it out: “I don’t want to get into the mechanics of exactly how we track and signal levels of concern, but yes – we’re very cognisant of which ones are elevated, and will pay particularly close attention to applying mitigation strategies wherever appropriate for those.”

However it’s done today, it may be done very differently tomorrow. Bacon sees “enormous” potential in the industry’s attempts to bring together [vast datasets](https://www.risk.net/asset-management/4940661/the-hard-labour-in-profiting-from-alternative-data), on-demand computing power, and [machine learning](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5355856/banks-apply-machine-learning-to-ccar-models). “I think a great deal will change over the next several years in terms of the most efficient ways to run a bank and provide our services. It is a huge deal,” he says.

For the risk function, he picks out three places where these new technologies could make a difference: [spotting anomalies](https://www.risk.net/asset-management/5312301/bloomberg-testing-use-of-image-recognition-in-volatility-trading), identifying trends and also processing natural language as part of a bank’s surveillance efforts.

The spread of these tools and techniques will place new demands on those using them.

“The risk manager of the future will be someone who knows how to deploy these techniques to the maximum benefit. That’s a mindset and skillset change that will occur – starting now and increasingly so over the next three to five years,” says Bacon.

He offers a little detail on how this shift is playing out at JP Morgan. The bank has already found some applications for new technology, Bacon says, with more creative and ambitious plans on the drawing-board. Teams of specialists now work on these efforts within the risk function.

“Within the group I’m responsible for, we absolutely have groups of data scientists performing these functions; and there’s a spectrum ranging from applications of big data techniques that are mature enough to be deployed, to some that are highly speculative and closer to R&D efforts. It is very important that all of this goes on at the same time, as we try to figure out the fastest route to responsibly deploy powerful new technologies,” he says.

So, what kind of things worry JPMorgan Chase’s chief risk officer? As it turns out, mostly the unknown – changes in the behaviour of the financial system that can only be guessed at in advance.

As one example, in the world of traded risk, Bacon raises a concern that the rise of non-bank market-makers – and the curtailed risk appetite of the banks – will produce [extreme volatility](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5351721/ubss-athanasopoulos-on-volatility-mifid-and-hedging-by-machine) during periods of stress. The theory is that non-banks – often perceived as having thin capital bases and little tolerance for losses – will retreat from the market during these periods, and that heavier capital burdens mean banks will be less able to cover the shortfall.

This theory has been largely untested in recent years, when there have been severe [intraday moves](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/market-risk/2384515/no-flash-crash-paulson-pimco-and-us-treasury-meltdown) in some markets, but few sustained periods of volatility.

“Perhaps we end up in more of a bimodal situation where in good times things are especially stable and less volatile, and in bad times they may be far more unpredictable and volatile than we have seen in the past. We haven’t experienced so much of the latter in recent years, but I do have a concern that when it inevitably comes, markets may be thinner and more volatile than we used to experience,” he says.

He chooses his words carefully when asked whether the current popularity of [short-volatility](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/structured-products/5311691/complex-short-vix-products-draw-fire-as-vol-plumbs-lows) strategies could magnify any future reversal. Trend-following and short-term self-fulfilment is nothing new, he says – but “I agree it could be a bit more pronounced now than it was in the last cycle.”

Bacon also worries about CCPs. Again, the system has changed – with more risk being underwritten by [a handful](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5299766/twin-member-default-would-hit-up-to-23-ccps) of big clearing houses – and it’s hard to know exactly [how it will cope](https://www.risk.net/cutting-edge/banking/2479766/systemic-risks-in-ccp-networks) with a crisis.

Here, the unknowns pile up quickly. Bacon is not primarily thinking about how CCP margin models will cope when markets get choppy, he’s worried about a [sudden gap](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/2475620/huge-brexit-margin-calls-stoke-intra-day-funding-fears), or an operational calamity – in other words, an unpredictable event hitting an untested system.

He says: “Risk management scaled for local volatility is interesting and has a level of importance, but what really matters is the extreme tail event, the big gap – or perhaps a big cyber threat to an exchange or CCP. Those things need to be considered.”

One thing that would help address these fears, he adds, are well-thought-out resolution plans and financial resources that are equal to the task of covering a disaster, without “incremental and unexpected assessments of members or taxpayers”.

In May, JP Morgan issued a [white paper](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/news/document/Office-of-Regulatory-Affairs-CCP-White-Paper.pdf?source=Office-of-Regulatory-Affairs-TSPgTile) on CCP resilience, recovery and resolution that – among other things – called for clearing houses to be bolstered by the same kind of bail-in debt that is designed to mop up unexpected losses at banks. Bacon repeats that call here.

“Exchanges are not banks and I don’t think of them as banks, but there are concepts around how banks are reasonably required to think about their own resolution that are applicable to an exchange or CCP. So to have other reliable resources – something like bail-in capital – available to cope with an extreme tail event seems a reasonable request,” he says.

Another unknown is the impact of new accounting rules that require banks to hold reserves equivalent to the expected [lifetime loss](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5303966/stage-fright-banks-tackle-ifrs-9-loan-loss-volatility) on their loan books, rather than losses that have already been incurred. In the US, the current expected credit loss standard takes effect from the start of 2020; elsewhere, International Financial Reporting Standard 9 applies as early as 2018.

Bacon agrees with the general thrust of the new rules – he likes “the idea of thinking carefully about how much money could be lost over the life of a loan – it is intuitively appealing to think about it that way.”

The “but” lingering after that sentence is partly about the interaction between existing capital requirements and the new loss reserves. Bacon says not all loans have a contractual maturity – credit card loans being one obvious example – which makes the concept of an expected lifetime loss more difficult to apply. If this results in conservative levels of reserving, then he suggests [capital levels](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5292961/basel-capital-floor-faces-credit-risk-eclipse) for those portfolios should be reviewed – and presumably cut.

And, finally, a slightly different problem: that of setting op risk capital requirements. In an April letter to shareholders, JPMorgan Chase’s Dimon called for the current approach to be overhauled or scrapped – his criticism being that the bank is having to hold capital to cover the [losses of the past](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/operational-risk/5318991/credit-suisse-seeks-capital-relief-for-resolution-unit), not the risks of the present.

An overhaul of the framework is underway at the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, with leaks from that process offering good and [bad news](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5298676/u-turn-on-sma-comparability-sparks-anger) for JP Morgan and other critics. The good news is that a document circulating among committee members in June suggested national regulators could be allowed to [ignore](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5292146/revised-sma-could-allow-banks-to-ignore-past-op-risk-losses) a bank’s loss history when calculating capital. The [bad news](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5298676/u-turn-on-sma-comparability-sparks-anger) is that removing this component would make a blunt proposal – to replace out-of-favour internal models – even more so. Under the arrangement, capital would be tied to a rough measure of size, which is not likely to help JP Morgan.

Bacon recognises the problem regulators face – it’s not easy to know how much capital to hold against huge, [rare losses](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/operational-risk/2244456/legally-blind-huge-settlements-overwhelm-op-risk-models) – but he warns against fudging the calculation: “It is a very hard problem to capital-model – to model tail loss in something with sporadic, episodic big events. So I do understand the attraction of proxies, but we have to discuss as an industry the flaws in simplistic proxies.”
