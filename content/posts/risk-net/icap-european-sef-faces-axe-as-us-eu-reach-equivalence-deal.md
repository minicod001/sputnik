Mutual recognition of trading venues by European Union and US regulators, agreed on December 5, could spell the end for TP Icap’s dual-registered swap execution facility in Europe.

The European Commission said in a statement released on December 5 that the venue-equivalence decision ensures EU counterparties can trade on US swap execution facilities (Sefs) any over-the-counter derivatives instruments that fall under the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive trading obligation.

At the same time, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced its staff had recommended an order of exemption from the Sef registration requirements for European multilateral and organised trading facilities. US counterparties could comply with the CFTC’s trade execution requirement by trading instruments subject to the requirement on MTFs and OTFs.

In the joint statement with the EC, CFTC chair Chris Giancarlo welcomed the decision, which is still provisional on its signing by his agency’s commissioners. “I also encourage my fellow commissioners to act expeditiously in approving the order,” he said.

The Icap Global Derivatives Limited (IGDL) European Sef is registered with the CFTC in the US and the Financial Conduct Authority in the EU. It was launched in 2014 to offer a global liquidity pool in G3 rates in a context of [swaps market fragmentation](https://www.risk.net/regulation/dodd-frank-act/5321541/industry-pushes-cftc-to-prioritise-cross-border-clarity), the first venue to do so. Dodd-Frank Act rules effectively prevented European market participants from trading with US counterparts regulated by the CFTC, except on a Sef.

However, this unique business proposition may have evaporated due to the equivalence deal between the EU and US that comes just weeks ahead of the sweeping reforms of European trading rules under Mifid II in January 2018.

An advisory source with knowledge of IGDL says no decision on the business’s future has been taken yet, but that the venue will probably close its business in Europe and move to the US, from where it will service clients on both sides of the Atlantic. However, TP Icap said it was too early to speculate on whether it will change the Sef’s status.

Julian Hammar, a lawyer at Morrison Foerster, says: “Icap’s dually-registered Sef reflects the policy the CFTC had in 2013: if any non-US trading facility has a US person participating on it, that facility would have to register as a Sef. The market may have thought there might be some opportunity for substituted compliance, but that was what the regulator stated. So Icap went that route. Most of the other European trading venues did not, and basically prohibited or shunned US participants because they did not want to become regulated as Sefs and be subject to dual registration.”

But a dual-registered Sef is probably no longer necessary, says Nihal Patel, a lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft: “Icap’s thinking [in 2014] was probably this: if we go ahead and register in both jurisdictions, if we swallow the pill that is the CFTC regulation, it may give us an advantage over our competitors. I can see that they may have put themselves in a unique position to offer services to customers in both the EU and the US.

“The reasons [IGDL] might have registered in the past with both regulators may disappear now, if a clear equivalence determination is provided. There isn’t much benefit to being registered and regulated on two sides if both sides are saying one or the other is good enough.”

When the equivalence deal is signed, the CFTC will be empowered under section 5h(g) of the Commodity Exchange Act to exempt European execution facilities from Sef registration where the facilities are subject to comparable comprehensive supervision and regulation on a consolidated basis by the appropriate government authorities from the home country of the facility, according to the implementing text of the deal.

Hammar says: “What is being contemplated for Sefs will be a straight exemption from registration for European platforms. So that means IGDL is in a situation where it was compliant with the former policy, articulated in 2013, but now the Sef will be rendered somewhat obsolete, unless TP Icap can convince the CFTC and the European authorities to enact some sort of comparability for them too, so that they could substitute compliance with one regime or the other.”

IGDL is not TP Icap’s only Sef, but it is its only dual-registered Sef. While TP Icap, as rebranded after Tullet Prebon acquired Icap’s global broker business in 2016, owns the IGDL, the Sef is managed separately. The non-brokerage part of Icap became Nex Group, which operates another dual-registered venue, for foreign exchange forwards.

According to a spokesperson for Nex: “For the Nex Sef, dual registration remains the clear path to compliance at this time. Though we do not see a downside to a common cross-border approach, it is too early to determine exactly what ‘equivalence’ entails and what the benefits will be.”
