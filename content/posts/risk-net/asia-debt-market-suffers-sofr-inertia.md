Familiarity breeds contempt, so the saying goes. But for bond users in Asia, the reverse seems to be true as the region’s debt markets cling to the long-standing Libor benchmark despite its widely anticipated demise at the end of 2021.

Issuance of floating rate notes linked to US dollar Libor in the region has soared from $10 billion in the first quarter of 2019 to $26 billion in the same period this year. Volumes only tailed off as the coronavirus pandemic extended its grip across financial markets.

With regulators urging banks and other participants to wean themselves off Libor, concerns are growing that Asia is lagging in its transition efforts.

“I worry particularly about the local banks [in Asia]. I don’t think they have a clue about what is happening with Libor,” says Andrew Ferguson, chief executive officer of the Asia-Pacific Loan Market Association in Hong Kong.

It all looked so different when Bank of China’s Macau subsidiary issued a three-year floating rate note linked to the new US risk-free reference rate last October. The $350 million deal raised expectations that more securities benchmarked to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) would soon ffollow

That hasn’t happened. Bond issuers cite the difficulty of switching internal systems to be able to handle a new fixing. Asian arms of large banks are also a few steps behind the main centres of London or New York in their projects to adopt new reference rates. The distractions of the coronavirus crisis have added a further impediment for many.

The process of building awareness of the new rate among the buy side has been slow, too. Libor is a forward-looking benchmark quoted across fixed tenors. Calculating the payout of a SOFR-linked note, however, involves compounding a series of rates in arrears.

“I think from a customer perspective, the feedback has been that customers still feel reluctant to switch from an in-advance, Libor-based benchmark to an in-arrears based benchmark,” says Chordio Chan, head of investment at Bank of China (Hong Kong).

Many are calling for a term version of risk-free rates to help give payment visibility for cash products. A term version of SOFR, though, is still in development and may not be ready until the middle of next year.

### Greenback funding

In Asia, US dollar Libor exists alongside local flavours of Ibor lending rates, such as Japan’s Tibor and Hong Kong’s Hibor. Authorities are encouraging market participants to switch from these fixings to overnight versions, although not all local Ibors will be discontinued permanently. US dollar Libor is likely to cease at the end of 2021, when regulators plan to stop compelling banks to submit lending quotes to the rate-setting panel.

Asia’s banks use US dollar Libor for note issuance and FX swaps to support their cross-border lending and borrowing operations, and to buy higher yielding dollar-denominated assets. The small size of some local bond markets means that banks and corporates rely on the larger dollar market for general funding needs.

Since 2019, the biggest issuers of floating rate notes linked to US dollar Libor have been companies and financial institutions in Japan and China. The two countries have been responsible for $35 billion and $30 billion in issuance volumes respectively, according to Bloomberg data.
