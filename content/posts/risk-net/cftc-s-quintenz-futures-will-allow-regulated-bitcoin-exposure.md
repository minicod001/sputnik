> _New products allow investors to access digital currency in a monitored marketplace, says CFTC commissioner_

Exchange-traded bitcoin can provide a way for investors to gain exposure to the digital currency in a venue with regulatory oversight, according to a US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) commissioner.

“Although there will always be bad actors in the market willing to engage in manipulative or fraudulent practices, the launch of bitcoinfutures provides investors an opportunity to trade bitcoin exposures in a regulated marketplace,” said commissioner Brian Quintenz in a speech at an International Swaps and Derivatives Association conference in London on November 30.

He said that registered derivatives clearing organisations (DCOs) have been providing the CFTC with information on how they intend to manage the risk associated with bitcoinfutures, and that the commission may increase margin requirements on the products in if it deems their risk to be inadequately covered.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the CBOE Futures Exchange have both announced that they intend to launch bitcoinfutures in the near future, subject to regulatory approval. [CME announced](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/5352311/cme-to-launch-bitcoin-futures) last month that it plans to offer the products in the fourth quarter of this year. The CBOE plans to do the same before the end of 2018. Speculation has also mounted that Nasdaq will follow suit next year.

The price of bitcoin has been rising exponentially, growing more than tenfold since the start of the year. On November 29, the price per coin hit $11,427, only to hit a low of $8,821 the next day. The daily trading volume now stands at $10 billion.

Despite the popularity of the product, many are sceptical of its safety. Bitcoin is a form of decentralised digital currency that runs on a peer-to-peer network of computers and is produced by miners working on open-source software. Transactions are validated by miners on a publicly visible ledger network, so a central intermediary is not required. Bitcoins are kept in so-called wallets, which can be vulnerable to hacking, with no regulatory protections available for investors.

Some market participants have long argued that digital currencies such as bitcoin and associated products [need to be regulated](https://www.risk.net/commodities/5353521/giancarlo-crypto-currency-futures-do-not-need-new-rules). This is not only for investor protection, but for monitoring market abuse – in 2014, then CFTC commissioner Mark Wetjen raised the possibility of traders manipulating cash bitcointo benefit a derivatives position.

Prior to listing new contracts, an exchange could either provide a written self-certification to the CFTC that the contract complies with the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and the commission’s regulations, or it could voluntarily submit the contract for approval. Unless the CFTC finds that the new product would violate the rules, the exchange may list the new contracts.

The CFTC’s Quintenz emphasised that as matter of practice, exchanges get the vast majority of new products approved through the self-certification process. And sometimes, in the case of novel products, the exchanges voluntarily provide the commission with advanced draft contract terms and conditions.

“This has been the case for bitcoin futures. For all the exchanges planning to use the self-certification process, our staff has had the opportunity to review the information provided by CME and the CBOE, engage in any discussions and evaluate whether any aspects of the contracts raise questions regarding compliance with the CEA or with our regulations,” he said.

As regards clearing, Quintenz said registered DCOs have been providing the CFTC with information on how they intend to manage the risk associated with bitcoin futures, and the commission staff have been reviewing this information. This includes examining how DCOs will meet appropriate initial margin requirements that are in line with the risk of the trades. The CFTC may also increase margin if it is deemed appropriate.

“After any contract is launched, commission staff will engage in a variety of risk-monitoring and oversight activities. These activities include monitoring and analysing open interest, initial margin requirements, variation margin payments as well as stress testing of positions. Commission staff will also conduct reviews of exchanges, clearing firms and of individual traders involved in trading and clearing of bitcoin futures. Further, if the commission determines that the margin DCOs hold against bitcoin futures is inadequate, it can take measures to require margin levels to increase,” said Quintenz.

However, he added that regulatory oversight does not mean the CFTC endorses any particular futures contact, including bitcoin.

“It is incumbent on market participants to conduct appropriate due diligence to determine whether these products, or any which have at times exhibited extreme volatility, are appropriate for them,” he said.
