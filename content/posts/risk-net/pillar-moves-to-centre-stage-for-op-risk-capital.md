The transatlantic divide that exists between US and European banks on expected changes in operational risk capital under Basel III could be smaller than it first appeared. While European banks in general will likely see an increase in their capital requirements, and US banks a decrease, the differences may be offset at least in part by Pillar 2 adjustments.

For European banks tipped to see a steep rise in Pillar 1 capital under the new approach, such clemency would be good news. But it could also breed uncertainty, and make capital planning difficult for banks – something Basel’s new standardised measurement approach (SMA) for operational risk capital, through its simplicity and predictability, was supposed to avoid – and fuel complaints of an unlevel playing field when it comes to prudential regulation.

“Since the financial crisis, the entire focus has been on Pillar 1,” says an op risk capital executive at a European bank. “Today, with the core Tier 1 ratios from most banks sufficiently stable, the focus is shifting to Pillar 2.”

The standardised approach rips up the previous own-models method for calculating op risk capital in favour of a set formula. A figure for a bank’s total income is combined with a multiplier, which depends on the bank’s size, to produce the business indicator component. This component is combined with an expression of the bank’s previous op risk losses, known as the internal loss multiplier, to produce the firm’s total op risk capital requirement.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s [quantitative [impact study](https://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/1720738/Ad+Hoc+Cumulative+Impact+Assessment+of+the+Basel+reform+package.pdf)](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.pdf), published alongside the final package of revisions to Basel III in December, projected that global systemically important banks (G-Sibs) migrating from the AMA to the standardised approach would see a reduction on average of 35% in op risk capital. The European Banking Authority’s own [impact study](https://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/1720738/Ad+Hoc+Cumulative+Impact+Assessment+of+the+Basel+reform+package.pdf) predicted that Europe’s largest banks migrating from the AMA would see a 28% increase on average.

Taken together, this implies non-European banks could see significant reductions in capital requirements.

“The European banks will see an increase in RWAs [risk-weighted assets] due to the fact that they are relatively small in comparison to the US banks,” says an op risk capital executive at a European bank. “For the ones that are reducing their footprint because they’ve pulled out of some businesses since the financial crisis, this is leading to a lower balance sheet. As a consequence, every bank will take measures to align RWAs to their balance sheet. On one hand, you have a lower business indicator, but you still carry along the legacy issues.”

Basel’s QIS noted one G-Sib migrating away from AMA will see a 222% increase. Practitioners suggest this is likely to be a bank that has incurred large conduct-related fines post-crisis while dramatically shrinking its footprint, so that its proportion of op risk-weighted assets to total assets has shot up.

Many have also speculated as to how individual banks will fare under the SMA. People familiar with the matter say that, among European banks, Santander could see a 50% increase in capital, and Societe Generale could see a 100% increase. Santander and Societe Generale declined to comment.

There are caveats to both impact studies, however. The standardised approach is not due to take effect until 2022, by which time some of the penalties under the 10-year lookback period will have dropped off. Both impact studies were based on 2015 data.

Even if some losses haven’t rolled off by 2022, regulators have latitude to allow banks to downplay past losses by setting a bank’s internal loss multiplier to 1. Under the final agreed framework, national regulators will be allowed to [neutralise](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5292146/revised-sma-could-allow-banks-to-ignore-past-op-risk-losses) the loss component within the calculation, which may benefit banks with outsized recent losses (see box: Basel’s internal loss multiplier). Banks will still be expected to disclose their historical op risk losses.

### Basel’s internal loss multiplier

A bank calculates its internal loss multiplier by dividing the loss component (a percentage of the average annual op risk losses for the bank over the previous 10 years) by the business indicator component (an expression of the bank’s size, based on its income, assets, and book size). This quotient is expressed in exponential terms.

Where the loss component and business indicator component are equal, the internal loss multiplier is 1. If the loss component starts to exceed the business indicator component, the multiplier creeps up beyond 1. So, as [Basel explains](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.pdf), a bank whose op risk losses are higher relative to its overall size is forced to hold proportionately more capital.

Conversely, a bank that has suffered low op risk losses would enjoy an internal loss multiplier lower than 1, enabling it to hold less capital.

Those banks that settled their mortgage securitisation-related [penalties](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/operational-risk/4081281/top-five-op-risk-losses-mortgage-fines-continue-to-plague-banks) early with US authorities are in better shape than those that didn’t, as these losses are in line to drop off sooner under the SMA’s 10-year lookback. UK bank RBS, for example, which has only recently settled its liabilities for mortgage misconduct, may see these fines linger painfully.

The impact of regulators’ attitudes here for individual banks could be sizeable. Deutsche Bank, for instance, had been tipped to see its op risk capital [rise massively](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/operational-risk/2475607/deutsche-bank-faces-op-risk-capital-hit-from-doj-fine) under the SMA, as a result of the large mortgage-backed securities mis-selling and Libor-rigging penalties it has incurred, among other regulatory fines and settlements. But if its regulator chooses to set its internal loss multiplier to 1, the bank could in fact see a neutral to positive impact to its minimum required capital, observers suggest. Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

Banks are also hopeful that by divesting or shuttering legacy businesses that suffered op risk losses, they can appeal to their domestic regulator for discretion to [exclude these losses](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5364236/banks-await-basel-decision-on-legacy-op-risk-losses) from their calculations.

### Pillar 2 leniency

The other area where regulators have latitude to dramatically shape the overall capital impact of the new op risk regime is their attitude to Pillar 2 add-ons.

A brief disclaimer in Basel’s QIS noted its projections “do not show supervisor-imposed capital add-ons. Therefore, increases in minimum required capital may be overstated and reductions may be understated.” Operational risk capital experts at banks suggest the impact could be significant.

US banks that anticipate falls in op risk capital requirements under the SMA may see balancing adjustments imposed by the Federal Reserve if the regulator decides that the amount of capital banks carry after migrating from AMA is insufficient.

“JP Morgan is a massive bank, and they have one of the highest op risk RWA charges under their current model,” says the op risk capital executive. “If they use the standardised approach, then they will see a massive drop. If the Fed says that’s what we consider the minimum requirement, we will simply give you an add-on under Pillar 2 to disallow you to benefit from any new regulation.” JP Morgan declined to comment.

Evan Sekeris, a partner at Oliver Wyman, agrees: “If your standardised capital drops compared to AMA, I suspect that banks would then adjust their economic capital numbers to decrease that gap. Banks might have to increase their Pillar 2 number a little bit to keep it above the new Pillar 1, but they’re not going to do a one for one increase.”

Similarly, not all European banks expect to see an increase in op risk capital under the new regime. “If you’re in a jurisdiction where AMA expectations were pretty loose, and the introduction of the SMA increases your Pillar1 capital, then the gap should decrease,” Sekeris says.

Banks calculate their Pillar 2 capital requirements [using their own methodologies](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5403881/op-risk-modelling-to-survive-move-to-sma). Regulatory expectations as to what should be modelled tend to be less prescriptive for Pillar 2, practitioners say – though some regulators do ask banks to model to a higher confidence interval. However, the principal regulatory expectation under the regime is that banks have a process for assessing their overall capital adequacy in relation to their risk profile.

### One rule for one

One other major element of uncertainty is that regulators tend to be idiosyncratic in their approach to Pillar 2 add-ons. One European AMA bank complains of a seemingly arbitrary near-30% increase in Pillar 2 charges last year: “The regulator looks at our calculation and may or may not increase the capital that we calculate,” says an op risk manager at the bank. “We have our add-on, they have theirs. The regulator last year added on something in the region of 30%. No explanation, absolutely nothing.”

Regulators in the US and UK make heavy use of Pillar 2, says the head of operational risk at another large European bank. Others, such as in Germany, tend to focus primarily on Pillar 1, he adds.

“A lot of European regulators don’t do too much in Pillar 2. It’s all done in Pillar 1. In the UK, you have a Pillar 1 calculation and Pillar2, and any adjustments to the Pillar 1 number are done in Pillar 2. In Germany, they are doing their adjustments in Pillar 1. So I think those regulators will shift their attention to Pillar 2. That’s been my experience from talking to a number of regulators,” he says.

UK regulators are said to be weighing [capital add-ons](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5389216/banks-wrestle-with-conduct-risk-capital-add-ons) under Pillar 2A for conduct-related risks. In 2017 [guidance](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/statement-of-policy/2017/the-pras-methodologies-for-setting-pillar-2a-capital-december-2017.pdf?la=en&hash=A157541ACACD7EC18CEA8C8695CDD5F30E5D1B53), the Prudential Regulation Authority noted the challenges associated with modelling conduct risk. Unlike other types of op risk that can be modelled using a loss distribution approach, conduct risk tends to carry much larger losses in the form of punitive legal and reputational costs. The loss distribution is unusually fat-tailed, with infrequent but very large losses, and there is a scarcity of data.

The PRA notes that its approach to Pillar 2A capital for conduct risk is informed by supervisory knowledge of a firm’s exposure to conduct risk; a firm’s largest conduct losses over the past five years; the level of expected annual loss for conduct risk; and conduct-related scenarios where potential exposures over a shorter time horizon (eg, five years) are considered. As a result, the determination of additional Pillar 2A capital for conduct risk is driven predominantly by supervisory judgment.

This would seem to suggest that modelling Pillar 2 capital must by definition involve some degree of scenario analysis – something which, ironically, the SMA explicitly excludes for Pillar 1 capital.

“There is currently no quantitative methodology for estimating Pillar 2 capital for conduct risk,” says Ruben Cohen, an independent risk consultant. “The only viable option is scenario analysis, which one might be able to use to translate fines and penalties into Pillar 2 capital.”

The models need to reflect the source of the losses, such as region, business unit, loss type, and further data categories that are relevant to the type of loss and the circumstances of the loss.

“We anticipate that the regulators would like banks to incorporate their improved data models into their Pillar 2 methodology,” says Chris Cormack, a partner at MP Capital Advisory Services. “We would expect the regulator to see a clear picture on how a loss arose within the context of the control frameworks that were in place to limit the losses.”

Although a forward-looking and more granular Pillar 2 model would be a desirable outcome, one of the criticisms of the AMA was that the modelling approaches weren’t comparable between banks. Therefore, regulators might seek to impose [stricter standards on Pillar 2](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5403881/op-risk-modelling-to-survive-move-to-sma) in an effort to promote comparability, including for banks that weren’t on AMA.

Typically, European banks were understood to have made more use of the [forward-looking nature](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5364236/banks-await-basel-decision-on-legacy-op-risk-losses) of scenario analysis under the old AMA to lower their capital by downplaying the effect of previous losses.

Some expect the Federal Reserve and European regulators to publish more formal guidelines on their expectations for Pillar 2 capital. “There will be guidance, some kind of rules coming out of the Fed regarding inclusion and non-inclusion of losses,” says Kabir Dutta, senior consultant at Charles River Associates.

The European Central Bank is expected to eventually specify expectations for Pillar 2 as part of its Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process for European banks. “This might result in banks being rewarded for advanced risk management techniques, but also being punished if they don’t have such techniques,” says David Nicolaus, manager of KPMG’s ECB office in Germany.
