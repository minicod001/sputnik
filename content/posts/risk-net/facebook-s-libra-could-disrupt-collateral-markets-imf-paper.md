Plans by Facebook and other private companies to issue so-called stablecoins backed by government securities could disrupt the supply of collateral to financial markets, says a new working paper from the International Monetary Fund.

In the IMF working paper, called [Privacy provision, payment latency and role of collateral](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/07/31/Privacy-Provision-Payment-Latency-and-Role-of-Collateral-49613), authors Charles Kahn, Caitlin Long and Manmohan Singh argue that digital currencies are analogous to collateral reuse, where securities are exchanged for cash. Looked at this way, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and commercial-bank sponsored tokens may be preferable to stablecoins, such as libra, which are issued by private companies without bank charters.

The balance sheets of central and commercial banks are flooded with reserves and deposits – a by-product of the quantitative easing (QE) and troubled asset purchase programmes of the past decade or so. Digital currencies can be backed by these reserves and deposits and issued in lieu of QE or asset purchases. These tokens could be a substitute for collateral trapped on central bank balance sheets and may improve market plumbing and lubrication.

“Underlying economics would favour issuing such tokens in lieu of the large central bank reserves and sizeable bank deposits,” the authors write. “Such digital tokens will be usable by all economic agents in all of the ‘pipes’ that underline market plumbing, thus akin to collateral reuse. This would improve market plumbing as tokens will be technologically more efficient and reusable like collateral.”

Stablecoins issued by private vendors without bank charters would have the opposite effect, trapping more collateral and making it unavailable for reuse by market participants. According to libra’s April 2020 [white paper](https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/#cover-letter), its coins will be at least 80% backed by government bonds with outstanding maturities of up to three months. “Tokens by private vendors without bank charters would silo more collateral as they do not have access to bank deposits or central bank reserves,” the paper states.

Not everyone agrees with the paper’s rationale. Arjun Jayaram, chief executive officer and founder of digital payments platform Baton Systems, disputes the characterisation of digital currencies as collateral. While there are similarities between tokens and collateral, they are not identical, he says; currencies are fungible, whereas most forms of collateral are not. This raises the question of what a counterparty may consider “acceptable collateral”, he says.

Singh, a senior financial economist at the IMF, maintains digital tokens are at least “akin to collateral” and that any new form of central bank or commercial bank money will “have important uses as collateral”.

“The devil will be in the detail, though,” says Long, founder and chief executive of Avanti Financial Group, and one of the co-authors. “Is the token actually money issued by a bank, or merely a money substitute issued by a non-bank? If the latter, will it be acceptable collateral?”

### Controlled disruption

Central banks and commercial lenders are well aware of the disruptive potential of digital currencies. A survey of 66 central banks published by the Bank for International Settlements in January found 80% of them were engaged in CBDC work – although only 10% expected to issue a digital currency within three years.

Some have already done so. In May, the Banque de France issued the first digital euros in exchange for reserves. The tokens were used to [complete a test trade](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7650991/socgens-digitised-bond-passes-settlement-test) and then redeemed for reserves later the same day. Sweden’s Riksbank is working with blockchain consortium R3 to create a digitised version of the krona that can be used on distributed ledger systems.

Commercial banks have also launched digital currencies, such as JP Morgan’s JPM coin, backed by customer deposits. Several other banks have backed a hybrid effort, called Fnality, to create a private digital currency supported by central banks.

If the collateral analogy holds true, non-bank issuers of stablecoins may need to rethink their plans. “The authors’ argument that any stablecoin or digital currency needs to resolve to an entity holding a bank charter or to central bank reserves in order for these tokens to be useful as collateral makes a lot of sense,” says Todd McDonald, co-founder of R3.

There are [signs](https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/payments/7532666/fednow-the-road-to-non-bank-access-to-us-instant-payments) major central banks are preparing to level the playing field between banks and non-banks. The Bank of England has given some non-bank payment service providers access to settlement accounts, and may also grant them access to its liquidity facilities. In the US, meanwhile, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency’s special-purpose banking charter would enable non-banks to make loans or engage in payment activities without having to go through a bank.

### ‘Lazy capital’

The threat to collateral markets may be existential. The paper suggests corporates will be early adopters of digital currencies, with firms that have higher capital costs likely to be first out of the gates.

“Multiple Fortune 500 companies have quietly been using bitcoin in small amounts since 2014, predominantly for transactions in countries without well-developed banking systems,” the authors write. “Corporate treasurers are up to speed on all developments in the faster payments area and are quickly able to pivot to solutions that make sense for them.”

Current payment systems that operate on a delayed net settlement basis require corporates to maintain large capital balances in accounts around the world, often to fund payments between subsidiaries. Settlement delays give rise to interest rate and counterparty risks, along with other costs and inefficiencies, which are shouldered by corporates.

The paper cites the example of one mid-capitalisation technology company that calculated savings from same-day settlement of $200 million – capital it could use to buy back shares or reinvest in its business. “In other words, the opportunity to strip out that much lazy capital from its capital structure is a powerful incentive to switch payment systems,” the authors write.

Banks, which have lower costs of capital than corporates, would see lower savings from moving to a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system using digital currencies.

R3’s McDonald agrees corporate treasurers moving to real-time payments to reduce their cost of capital “is definitely a trend in play”, although he has not seen them using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to date.

The paper concludes that “the economic incentives for corporate treasurers to switch from legacy payment systems to new RTGS are powerful. The big question is: which one, and how fast?”

A corporate treasurer at a large European company suggests CBDCs and commercial bank tokens will be the preferred choice. “Regarding tokens, as long as these came from some private companies, I doubt the ‘fiat’ effect would be good enough for non-financial customers,” he says. “You’d either need some governmental involvement or a larger consortium including major banks, in my opinion.”

That will be a relief to those active in collateral markets.
