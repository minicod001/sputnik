Indicators of liquidity risk at top US banks improved over the three months to end-June as their portfolios of easy-to-sell assets grew.

Aggregate high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) at the eight US global systemically important banks (G-Sibs) hit $2.78 trillion in Q2, an increase of 15% quarter on quarter.

JP Morgan reported the biggest increase of the group dollar-wise, with its stock of HQLA growing 19% to $651.2 billion over the quarter.

Bank of America’s HQLA rose by 18% to $549.2 billion, Citi’s 11% to $489.8 billion, Wells Fargo’s 7% to $409.5 billion, Morgan Stanley’s 19% to $207.6 billion, Goldman Sachs’ 18% to $211.3 billion, State Street's 23% to $101.8 billion, and BNY Mellon’s 9% to $155.6 billion.

The surge in HQLA led to higher liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs) at all but two of the G-Sibs.

Morgan Stanley’s rebounded the most quarter on quarter, by 20 percentage points to 147.4%, followed by Goldman Sachs’, which climbed 13 percentage points to 143.9%.

On the flip side, BNY Mellon’s LCR dropped over two percentage points to 111.7%, and State Street’s 20 basis points to 108.96%.

### What is it?

The [LCR](https://www.risk.net/topics/liquidity-coverage-ratio-lcr) is one of two liquidity ratios introduced by the Basel Committee in the wake of the financial crisis and implemented in the US by the Federal Reserve. It requires banks to maintain a sufficient stock of liquid assets – HQLA – to cover projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period of stress.

Eligible HQLA are split into three categories. Level 1 assets consist of central bank deposits and US Treasury securities; Level 2A assets are agency mortgage bonds guaranteed by US government-sponsored entities; and Level 2B assets are certain liquid corporate and municipal bonds.

Combined Level 2 assets may not exceed 40% of a bank’s total stock of HQLA. In addition, Level 2 assets are subject to haircuts: 15% for Level 2A and 50% for Level 2B. Amounts used in this story are net of these haircuts.

### Why it matters

When the coronavirus crisis first hit, corporations and financial institutions alike stampeded out of risk assets and into cash. They [deposited their dollars](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/banks/7529666/us-banks-leverage-soared-in-q1-before-feds-reprieve) at the top banks, which in turn stuffed them into their accounts at the Federal Reserve or into US Treasury bonds. Cash piled up so much at the top G-Sibs that the Fed introduced a temporary change to the [supplementary leverage ratio](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7667976/systemic-us-banks-leverage-exposures-shrank-14tn-in-q2) (SLR) to stop them bumping up against regulatory capital limits.

Thanks to this relief, the systemic banks are not under pressure to rid their balance sheets of cash, allowing them to reap the benefit of higher HQLA stocks without the associated capital burden. Since markets calmed over the second quarter, net cash outflows did not surge at the same pace as HQLA, leading to the LCR increases at most of the G-Sibs.

However, with the SLR relief slated to [expire on March 31, 2021](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7522166/banks-fear-time-limit-on-fed-leverage-ratio-reprieve), top lenders may soon start having to reduce their piles of cash and Treasuries. All else being equal, this should cause LCRs to drift lower over time.
