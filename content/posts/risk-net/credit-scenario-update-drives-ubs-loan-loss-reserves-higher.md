UBS downgraded its economic outlook in Q2 as the coronavirus pandemic worsened. The change contributed to a $272 million provision charge to cover souring loans.

Expected credit loss (ECL) provisions taken for IFRS 9 stage one and two loans – those that are yet to default – hit $202 million for the three months to end-June, up from $89 million in Q1. Of this amount, $127 million was taken to reflect the bleaker macroeconomic assumptions included in its forward-looking credit models. Another $75 million was made up of amounts to cover ratings migrations, expert judgement add-ons, and model changes.

UBS used two credit scenarios to produce ECL provisions for its performing loans. The baseline scenario assumes GDP drops 6.4% in the US, 8.2% in the eurozone and 5.5% in Switzerland in 2020. Unemployment across the three geographies is assumed to peak at 14.1%, 9.8% and 3.9%, respectively. These indicators are projected to improve in 2021, but to remain below their pre-pandemic levels until 2022.

A worst-case “global crisis” scenario assumes a deep, prolonged recession with a slow recovery starting in 2021. For the purposes of setting Q2 ECL provisions, the baseline scenario was assigned a weighting of 70%, and the more severe scenario 30%. At end-2019, the baseline-severe weighting was 85% to 15%.

Stage three provisions, for loans in default, totalled $70 million for Q2. These included amounts to cover soured loans in the investment banking division, a $20 million legacy energy exposure, a $9 million margin loan made by the wealth management unit and $10 million across two big corporate accounts.

The losses were partially offset by recoveries in energy, securities financing, and real estate investment trust portfolios.

### Who said what

“During the quarter, we updated both our baseline and our global crisis scenarios. The new baseline scenario assumes a sharp deterioration of GDP in relevant markets and increasing unemployment with the largest shocks in the US. Our baseline scenario forecasts improvements in the various macroeconomic indicators beginning in the second half of 2020, but with a slower recovery expected in the US relative to Switzerland and the eurozone and with US GDP remaining below pre-crisis levels until 2022. The baseline scenario also assumes US unemployment will remain in double digits until mid-2021,” – Kirt Gardner, chief financial officer at UBS.

### What is it?
Provisions for credit losses are taken out of income each quarter to cover expected shortfalls in payments from loans and other credit instruments.

Accounting standard [IFRS 9](https://www.risk.net/topics/international-financial-reporting-standard-9-ifrs-9) obliges banks to set reserves for credit assets in line with their expected future losses.

The framework is based on a three-stage classification of assets. Stage one assets are those that have suffered no breakdown in credit quality; stage two have experienced a big drop in credit quality; and stage three have actually become impaired.

Assets in the first group need to be backed by sufficient reserves to cover 12 months of ECLs. Those in the other two must be provisioned for ECLs over their entire lifetime.

### Why it matters
Credit conditions are evolving rapidly, and banks are racing to keep up. UBS last reviewed its forward-looking economic scenarios in March soon after the coronavirus crisis first hit, assuming “modest economic improvements ... from the second half of 2020”. This expectation has now been downgraded as the economic fallout of the pandemic has worsened, particularly in relation to the US.

The severity of the revision is clear from the far larger amount of provisions set aside to account for changed credit expectations. Still, UBS may hope that its gloomier forward-looking projection means it won’t have to take such a large provision over subsequent quarters, as pandemic-induced credit losses should now been ‘baked in’. It may even be able to release a quantity of reserves in future periods if the US recovers faster than anticipated.

What also stands out about UBS’s provisions is the large amount added through expert judgement. This implies the bank’s credit risk models aren’t entirely trusted to produce an adequate reserve figure for certain exposures, which makes sense considering the unprecedented economic environment. However, it means that some degree of future expected losses have been arrived at using guesswork. These predictions may be greatly outstripped by reality, putting UBS on the hook for more than it anticipated.
