{{< quote steelblue >}}_Industry body is updating unloved procedure for valuing terminated swaps_{{< /quote >}}

It’s a common problem in derivatives markets.

A buy-side firm wants out of a swap, so approaches its dealer counterparty to terminate the trade. In doing so, it risks opening “a whole can of worms”, as Simon Firth, a capital markets partner at Linklaters, put it during a recent conference call hosted by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.

The problem is that the two parties must agree on a cash value for the remaining portion of the contract. Typically, a calculation agent is nominated to gather quotes from other banks. But Isda’s current rulebook doesn’t make clear whether collateral, credit and funding should be factored into those quotes – questions that have become weightier since the rules were last overhauled. Banks are often reluctant to provide quotes due to this lack of clarity. Buy-side firms complain this leaves too much power in the hands of the calculation agent – usually the executing dealer.

The matter is set to be addressed in a revamp of the Isda interest rate derivatives definitions, which the trade body intends to publish by year-end.

“People are having to come up with their own ways of determining cash settlement amounts, and that leads to potentially unnecessary divergence in the market, which Isda can help resolve by updating the standardised cash settlement provisions,” says Rick Sandilands, senior counsel in Europe for Isda.

“The idea behind the 2020 definitions is to keep what works well under the 2006 definitions, but provide market participants with something that is modernised and more reflective of the current regulatory and market environment,” he adds.

The new rules are still in draft form, and few market participants are willing to comment on them openly. But there are rumblings of discontent over parts of the proposed methodology for basing valuations on credit support annexes, or CSAs – the swaps market’s standard collateral agreement.

The new definitions assume a calculation agent will obtain quotes based on a standardised CSA. Real-world CSAs, though, can differ markedly from the boilerplate version, meaning quotes could vary from those a client might itself receive.

Parties can choose to source quotes on the basis that the transactions are uncollateralised, with no CSA, or they can use their exact CSA terms. The latter option requires firms to disclose the details of their agreements to the banks providing the quotes – leading to fears of sensitive information leaking into the market.

Or the calculation agent can obtain quotes from dealers based on other CSAs in place with the party that is financially compensated for early termination. The agent can adjust the resulting valuations to account for the differences between those CSAs and the one that relates to the terminated transaction. However, this may introduce discretions that the buy side initially wanted to exorcise.

Negative interest rates will also apply when calculating interest payable on posted variation margin – another contentious topic that split that market in 2015. But derivatives valuation adjustments will be excluded, removing a source of confusion in the current rules.

In a further change, the new definitions will allow firms to nominate one of the two sides of the trade as a ‘protected party’. This would generally be the party that stands to lose financially from the early termination.

Andres Krapf, head of derivatives management at Axa Investment Managers, says it may be some time before swaps users are able to adopt the new provisions. And when they do, the changes won’t always be straightforward.

“The question is whether there will be a gradual move to these new definitions for new trades, but again, this requires one of two things. Either you already have the standard CSA, in which case it’s fully painless to move to this definition, or you have a different CSA than the standard,” he says.

He explains that a non-standard CSA may require counterparties to use a different discount curve from the one in a standard CSA.

“I see people moving into this kind of definition if the standard CSA is already what they have in place as their real CSA, and I see it to be more complex if not,” he adds.

### The old way

The vagueness of the existing cash settlement methodology has long been a bugbear for some market participants.

The 2000 Isda definitions spell out five different ways of determining the cash settlement valuation of an early terminated swap. Under the cash price method, a common technique, the calculation agent obtains quotes from at least three other banks to determine the settlement amount.

The quotes can be at bid, ask or mid, and if there are fewer than three quotes available, the calculation agent determines the settlement amount.

The 2000 definitions state that banks providing quotes should assume the counterparty “is a dealer in the relevant market of the highest credit standing”, and “no account will be taken of any existing credit support document”.

Lawyers say it is unclear if this means dealers should assume the trade is uncollateralised, with no CSA. Firth at Linklaters points out that collateral is required when credit is a concern, and it may be a regulatory requirement too. The reference to a credit support document need not apply to the specific transaction for which the dealer is providing a quote.

However, ignoring the CSA of the client overlooks a raft of elements that can affect the valuation of a trade.

A trade with no CSA generates counterparty credit risk capital charges for the dealer, and would generally see the bank charge more to cover the cost of hedging this risk. The 2000 definitions don’t specify whether such a cost, known as a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) charge, should be included in the final quote, and there are differences of opinion on whether it should.

If the dealer assumes there is no CSA and includes CVA costs, and the client in fact has a CSA, it would result in a worse quote than justified.

It’s the same story with funding valuation adjustment, which covers the cost of funding a trade where one side is collateralised and the other is not. If the bank is in-the-money to the uncollateralised party, it will have to fund the margin to post to the collateralised hedge itself, creating a cost that is usually baked into the price up front. If the client has a CSA, again it could be unfairly penalised if the cash settlement quotes assume no collateralisation.

Under the existing rules, the calculation agent is allowed to determine whether derivatives valuation adjustments are included, and some buy-side firms are thought to be unhappy with the discretion offered to this third party.

### Settling the score

This is why the industry was keen to tackle the issue as part of the new 2020 definitions. Isda set up a working group last year to look into cash settlement provisions. The association declines to reveal which companies or individuals are participants in the group, nor how large the group is.

Isda is also believed to be working with the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association to canvass the buy side on the update to the provisions. Sifma declined to comment on any discussions.

Under the new rules, the default methodology for determining the cash settlement price of an early terminated swap will be the mid-market valuation. This approach gives the option to either ask dealers for quotes, or for the calculation agent to determine the settlement value.

If quotes are being taken, like in the old definitions, the dealer will be asked to provide a price for the net present value of the payments that would have been due from the parties under the transaction for the remaining term of the swap.

But this time a CSA can be used as reference for the quotes. The quoting banks will assume a standardised CSA is in place, based on the 2016 variation margin template. Alternatively, counterparties can use their own existing CSA as the reference.

The calculation agent can also source quotes assuming that the counterparty has no CSA in place. In this case, the discount rate would need to be agreed between the parties, otherwise the agent will use one from a menu of back-up choices known as a settlement matrix.

A deterrent for counterparties in using an existing CSA is that they may be required to disclose the terms of the agreement to the quoting banks.

“This is one of the aspects where there’s likely to be further discussion on this point,” says Ilene Froom, partner at Reed Smith, which represents a number of buy-side firms that have been contributing to the drafting of the definitions. “You could have a hypothetical CSA so that parties don’t have to disclose the actual CSA between them, because there are confidentiality issues where people may not want their CSA provided for this type of valuation purpose.”

It is thought that any sensitive information in the agreement could be redacted to preserve confidentiality.

### Skewed quotes

One of the problems with using a standard CSA is the valuation may not reflect the terms of the real-world CSA. Take multi-currency CSAs as an example. These allow counterparties to post the cheapest to deliver cash currency at any point in time. As the discount rate of the relevant trades is determined by the collateral posted, changing the cash currency can affect the value of a trade. So quotes under these types of CSAs tend to be more expensive for clients.

However, the standard variation margin CSA assumes that each underlying exposure is collateralised with cash in the relevant currency. That means the calculation agent’s quotes would not include the value of the optionality, resulting in different quotes from the multi-currency CSA.

Similarly, many clients like to have the option to post bonds as variation margin. This can affect banks’ capital requirements, because the posted bonds add to a bank’s leverage ratio exposure, whereas cash margin nets it down. The net stable funding ratio also prohibits non-cash margin from being used to reduce derivatives assets. Again, the calculation agent would receive differing quotes for these CSA variants.

Up for discussion is whether dealers can make a basis adjustment when the cashflow currency is in a different currency from the interest rate benchmark. This would be one of the only adjustments that dealers could make to their zero-coupon curve – no other price adjustments could be made by the quoting dealers for elements such as credit or funding valuation adjustments.

This is to “determine a clean theoretical price for the transaction”, said Suzanna Brunton, managing associate at Linklaters on the Isda conference call.

Negative rates are also determined to apply to interest rates on variation margin posted. However not everyone backs this idea. An Isda protocol in 2014 allowed parties to specify whether negative rates applied, but failed to gain widespread support. Litigation on the matter between the Dutch state treasury and Deutsche Bank ended up in England’s High Court [in May last year](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6615291/court-rules-for-deutsche-in-negative-interest-case).

This means that when the 2020 definitions come into force, negative rates can apply to early terminations, even if a counterparty did not sign up to the protocol.

However, Krapf says this is no longer relevant for most CSAs.

“It was an issue back in 2015, where like everybody else we had our share of contentious interpretations and we had to sort that out then. But from my point of view this was sorted out years ago, and I believe most of the market is now standardised,” he says.

### Like for like

The updated definitions contain an alternative version of the mid-market valuation methodology. Known as the replacement value, it allows both counterparties to source quotes instead of a calculation agent, although they have to use the same standard CSA to generate quotes unless a bespoke CSA is used. Alternatively, a calculation agent can simply be appointed to determine the cash settlement amount without having to source quotes.

Unlike the mid-market value methodology, which is designed to find a neutral valuation which doesn’t favour either party, the replacement value technique is designed to protect one of the parties from the financial impact of the termination. There is flexibility to choose which party you are trying to protect, typically the party that would lose out from early termination.

The idea is to calculate how much it would cost the protected party if it were to go out into the market and replace the transaction. To this end, a calculation agent obtains quotes based on the protected party’s CSA between it and the quoting dealers.

If the CSA used to generate the quotes here is different from the one between the two counterparties to the trade, the calculation agent can adjust the settlement amount to make up the difference, but the parties would have to specify this as part of the prescribed documentation adjustment in the confirmation. This is one of a couple of instances where the calculation agent can exercise discretion.

“Having more details around the calculation agent, including its responsibilities and standards, in the 2020 definitions will be in my opinion very helpful for the market,” says Froom at Reed Smith.

Isda intends to seek feedback on its proposed provisions in due course, with responses limited to members of the working group and buy-side trade associations. The association declined to give a specific timeline for the consultation.

Experts predict debate will centre on whether counterparties will be comfortable in disclosing the terms of their CSAs to the quoting banks if they choose to use an existing CSA as a reference. With the new cash settlement methodologies intending to cater for both single and multiple currency swaps, there are also questions over whether the existing cross-currency method should be included in the 2020 definitions (see box: The cross-currency method).

It is also yet to be decided whether dealers will be able to make any additional adjustments to their zero-coupon curve other than a basis adjustment in the case that the cashflow currency is in a different currency from the interest rate benchmark. And the buy side will be carefully looking to see whether the new provisions adequately deal with calculation agent discretion.

With much still up for discussion, the association’s aim to finalise the updated definition before year-end looks ambitious. “Our target is to publish the definitions by the end of the year,” says Isda’s Sandilands. “Of course, we keep in communication with our members and our board on timing but that’s the target.”

### The cross-currency method

Cross-currency swaps are treated a little differently in the existing definitions, and the same goes for the 2020 version. The instruments have their own cash settlement method, which was added to the 2006 definitions via supplement 23 in 2010.

Under the cross-currency cash settlement method, the calculation agent must obtain quotes from reference banks for the net present value of each currency cashflow in the transaction. The quotes are an amount that would be paid to enter into a transaction that would keep the economic equivalent of each currency cashflow.

This means the cross-currency method is a sort of hybrid of net present value and replacement value costs.

The new definitions contain a provision known as the mid-market valuation indicative quote, which applies to a range of interest rate derivatives including cross-currency swaps.

Rick Sandilands at Isda says some members have suggested the cross-currency cash settlement method remain in the 2020 definitions for a period of time to allow for a transition to the newer methodologies.

Speaking on the Isda conference call, Suzanna Brunton at Linklaters said: “There was a feeling in the working group that [the cross-currency cash settlement method] should be retained for now until such time as firms are confident that mid-market valuation indicative quotations is a suitable method for cross-currency swaps and can therefore be substituted for the default cash settlement method.”

Regardless of whether the methodology is changed in the 2020 definitions, legacy trades will remain unaffected, says Jonathan Martin, director of market infrastructure and technology at Isda.

“Just because we’re not perpetuating something in the 2020 definitions, that doesn’t mean that it completely goes away. It will remain in the 2006 definitions and will still be valid for those legacy transactions,” he says.
