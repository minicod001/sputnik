Top eurozone dealers saw capital charges for their securitisation exposures lurch higher over the first half of the year, in part due to a mandatory change to the risk-weight floor used to backstop assessments of their creditworthiness.

Deutsche Bank led a set of four systemically important eurozone lenders in risk-weighted asset (RWA) amounts for securitisation exposures in the banking book. These increased 22% over the six months to end-June, to €14.2 billion ($16.8 billion). Trading book exposures accounted for €2.5 billion of RWAs, up over one-third on end-December.

The German lender attributed the spike – which translated to a banking book securitisation charge of €1.1 billion – to a compulsory switch, on January 1, to the EU’s new [securitisation regime](https://www.risk.net/our-take/6605781/eus-new-securitisation-market-stumbles-out-of-the-gate), which among other things raised the lowest risk-weighting permitted for an exposure to 15% from 7%.

At Deutsche, this resulted in a large migration of exposures from the less-than-10% risk weight bucket to the 10-20% one, pushing RWAs and own funds requirements up in tandem. This outweighed the capital-reducing effect of a 10% cut in banking book exposures and 8% drop in trading book positions over the period.

It was a similar story at other banks laden with securitisations. At BNP Paribas, banking book exposures generated RWAs of €13.9 billion – 32% up on end-December. Trading book RWAs topped €805 million, up 63% on end-2019.

Though the French lender did not break down exposures by risk-weight over the period, it said only €749 million of the first half RWA increase was attributable to a build up of positions and deterioration in credit quality, while €2.5 billion was added because of methodology and policy changes – which include the effects of the floor change.

BNP’s peer Crédit Agricole posted a 30% RWA jump over the period, to €9.8 billion. At Spain’s Santander, RWAs reached €7.7 billion at end-June, almost double end-2019’s €3.9 billion. The figure was, however, low relative to total exposures, which amounted to €130 billion – by far the most among the banks surveyed.

### What is it?

Amendments to the European Union’s Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the introduction of the [Securitisation Regulation](https://www.risk.net/our-take/6605781/eus-new-securitisation-market-stumbles-out-of-the-gate) ushered in a new framework for setting capital charges for securitisations, which came into full effect on January 1.

Banks must now slot securitisations into one of three risk calculation methodologies: an internal ratings-based approach (IRBA), which can only be used on own-originated transactions, an external ratings-based approach (ERBA) that uses data from credit rating agencies, and a standardised approach that uses the standardised credit risk profile of underlying exposures as the main input.

Lower risk weightings apply to assets which meet [simple, transparent and standardised](https://www.risk.net/regulation/6550261/into-the-void-europes-new-but-hazy-securitisation-market) criteria under the EU rules.

### Why it matters

Prior to this January, only exposures to securitisations originated from 2019 onwards had to be risk-weighted according to the new framework. Now, with the new rules fully in effect, all exposures are subject to the higher risk-weight floor, regardless of vintage.

At Deutsche, the framework switch was explicitly cited as the culprit behind swelling RWAs. Similarly, at BNP Paribas it’s easy to read the effects of the new regime in the breakdown of RWA moves.

At Santander, the risk-weight floor change was also clearly the driver of the RWA surge.

The amount of exposures classified in the less-than-20% securitisation risk-weight bucket grew 16%, or €5.6 billion, to almost €41 billion over H1, while those tagged with risk-weights 100% and higher dropped a massive 78%, to €2.8 billion. Therefore, Santander’s RWAs reflect the large amount of low-risk positions it held over the first half which saw their capital requirements hiked by the floor change.

But at Crédit Agricole it was a different story. The bank did not disclose its actual securitisation exposures, but a restatement of its end-2019 exposures to reflect the impact of the new capital framework showed barely any increase in RWAs. This implies that most of the increase in the subsequent six months arose from changes to its book’s size and quality.
