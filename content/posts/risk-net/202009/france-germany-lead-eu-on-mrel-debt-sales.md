Big French banks issued over €66 billion ($77.9 billion) of bail-in bonds over the last 11 years, data from the [European Banking Authority](https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/930920/What%20are%20the%20determinants%20of%20MREL%20-eligible%20debt%20yields.pdf) (EBA) shows, the most across the European Union.

The total amount of debt sold to comply with the EU’s minimum requirements for eligible liabilities (MREL) rules by 50 top-tier banks and 13 mid-sized issuers between 2009 and 2019 was €246.7 billion. French banks accounted for 27% of the total, UK banks 16% and German banks 15%.

German banks led the EU in the number of issuances made over this period, with 99, compared to French banks’ 82. Belgian and Portuguese banks sold the fewest, just three apiece over the 11 years. Norwegian lenders sold the least, euro-wise, with just €457 million issued.

The mean MREL issuance size across the sample was €705 million, and the average maturity 10.6 years. For global systemically important banks (G-Sibs), the respective figures were €969 million and 11 years, and for other systemically important institutions, €551 million and 9.9 years.

MREL debt sales peaked in 2019, with a total of €42.3 billion bonds placed.

### What is it?

The [Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive](https://www.risk.net/topics/bank-recovery-and-resolution-directive-brrd) instituted MREL to make sure troubled banks could recapitalise without resort to public funds.

The EU’s Systemic Risk Board, together with national resolution authorities, started assessing banks’ loss-absorbing capacities in 2016. The following year it started developing binding requirements for major banking groups and, in 2018, began setting specific targets.

### Why it matters

EU banks have their work cut out to fill up their bail-in buffers with MREL debt. A recent study by the EU’s Systemic Risk Board found that seven out of the 16 resolution groups that make up the 11 EU G-Sibs had an aggregate [MREL shortfall](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7439991/systemic-eu-banks-bail-in-requirements-vary) of €51.3 billion.

Making up these deficits could prove expensive. The EBA reported [earlier this year](https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Risk%20Analysis%20and%20Data/Risk%20Assessment%20Reports/2020/Thematic%20notes/883986/Thematic%20note%20-%20Preliminary%20analysis%20of%20impact%20of%20COVID-19%20on%20EU%20banks%20%E2%80%93%20May%202020.pdf) that the coronavirus crisis has caused MREL prices to spike. If these stay elevated, firms’ debt issuances could hobble their future profitability.

The presence of top G-Sibs in France and Germany likely explains why these jurisdictions have seen the most MREL sales, and it also makes sense that the quantity of debt sold has accelerated in recent years as binding requirements have started to take effect. But those non-systemic firms in smaller jurisdictions that waited for the top-tier lenders to get their issuances out of the way before tapping the market themselves may now be regretting their decisions, considering the soured market environment.
