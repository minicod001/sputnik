Market participants are increasingly turning to US government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) and agency debt over Treasuries as collateral for tri-party repo transactions, data from the [Office of Financial Research](https://www.financialresearch.gov/short-term-funding-monitor/datasets/repo-single/?mnemonic=REPO-TRI_TV_T-P) (OFR) shows.

On September 4, tri-party repo transactions backed by GSE debt accounted for 37% of the $1.25 trillion total. This is up from a year-to-date low of 30% on March 31, and above the six-year average of 31%. Trades backed by US Treasuries made up 43% of the total, down from a year-to-date peak of 57% on March 31, and below the six-year average of 48%.

The average rate for GSE-backed trades was 10 basis points as of September 4, the level it’s been hovering around since late March, when the Federal Reserve cut the base rate to 0.25%. For US Treasury trades, the average rate was 0.09bp, for corporate bond trades 0.35bp and for transactions using other types of collateral 0.26%.

Total tri-party transactions hit a six-year high of $1.58 trillion on March 17 this year, at the height of the coronavirus-fuelled market crisis. Volumes for September 4 were 21% lower than this peak, and are down 9% on September 4 2019.

### What is it?

The OFR [US repo markets data release](https://www.financialresearch.gov/short-term-funding-monitor/) contains daily data on rates and volumes in centrally cleared and tri-party repo markets, broken out by tenor and underlying collateral.

### Why it matters

Transaction data for general collateral financing (GCF) repo published by the OFR does not show a steady increase in the share of daily transactions being conducted using GSE debt, and the agency does not publish a breakdown of delivery-versus-payment transactions routed through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) by collateral type.

It may be that since the FICC [dominates](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/6830466/ficc-dominates-us-treasury-repo-in-q2) US Treasury repo, fewer trades using these securities as underlying collateral are being conducted tri-party. Another explanation could be that with the Federal Reserve buying up mortgage bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, market participants perceive them to be just as safe and solid as Treasuries, and therefore effective substitutes as repo collateral.
