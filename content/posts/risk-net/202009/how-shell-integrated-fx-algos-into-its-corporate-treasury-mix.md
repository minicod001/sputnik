Back in 2010, the use of algorithms to execute foreign exchange spot transactions was in its infancy, and those dipping their toes into the new world were limited primarily to hedge funds and large asset managers. But a handful of corporates were interested at the time, one being oil giant Shell.

As well as being one of the world’s largest oil companies, with operations spanning more than 70 countries, it has long been one of the more forward thinking in the FX space. So, when a new way to execute large orders in a way that could provide a company the size of Shell with lower execution costs appeared, it jumped at the chance.

Ten years on, and Shell is now so comfortable with algos that up to half of its FX spot volume is executed that way, which equates to hundreds of billions of dollars of flow each year.

“It goes up and down depending on what we’re looking to achieve and on how the currency split changes. We use algos in some currencies more than others, depending on what liquidity looks like in the market, but it’s fair to say it can be up to 50%,” says Michael Dawson, head of liquidity and foreign exchange at Shell.

The algos have changed a fair bit in that time. In the beginning, Dawson says there were only around half a dozen banks offering relatively simple time-based algos that would slice up orders and execute them in pre-determined clips. Transaction cost analysis (TCA) was in its infancy, so the company built its own tool to measure algo effectiveness.

Now, a significant number of Shell’s relationship banks offer execution algos, with some touting hybrid versions powered by machine learning that can adapt their execution styles to changing market conditions. A third-party firm looks after its algo TCA these days.

But for Shell, they still keep things relatively simple, preferring to focus on very passive algos where the company posts bids on central limit order books and waits to be taken out of their positions, taking more of a risk that the market will move against them, but earning the bid/offer spread in the process. Most of its algo flow goes through products from fewer than a dozen banks.

The benefits of using algos for Shell are not limited to earning the spread. Anonymity is important for Dawson, giving the company the ability to reduce potential market impact on larger trades by transacting under the bank’s name. Algos also allow for more automation of orders that pass through his team.

“We’re trying to reduce our go-to-market costs, and they can take many forms, be it spread that’s paid to banks or market impact from our flow. We’re trying to minimise the amount of spread we pay and minimise the market impact or the signalling impact that we may have.”

Many emerging markets pairs are too illiquid for passive algos, of course; some are also considered too liquid, such as euro/US dollar, because there isn’t any spread left to earn.

“We find they tend to work best on those currency pairs where there is sufficient liquidity, but where there is a spread,” says Dawson.

“In euro/US dollar, it’s very tight and we see razor-sharp pricing from our relationship banks. So we have less of a need to go and pay a fee for an algo,” he adds.

He cites pairs such as US dollar against the Aussie, Canadian and Singapore dollars, and sterling, as strong candidates for passive algo execution. The company also frequently uses passive algos in the Scandinavian markets.

### Less is more

Shell’s balance sheet is denominated in dollars, with the bulk of its FX exposures coming from local revenue streams, operations and capital exposures in its downstream refinery and distribution businesses. Execution is based on actual cashflows – that is, when they have cash outflows, it’s at that point they’ll look to convert.

Shell’s 2019 annual report states its main exposures are to the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, euro and sterling.

The company operates with a centralised FX treasury, with virtually all trades sent to two major centres in London and Singapore, where it is netted and then executed. The treasury also has an agency model where it can transact directly on behalf of operating units in countries such as Brazil, China and Malaysia.

There are 10 people in Shell’s treasury that specialise in FX, including Dawson, who joined the company in June 2008 and has been in his current role since 2015. Prior to that, he was in corporate treasury at Procter & Gamble.

The oil giant announced a partnership with Bloomberg a few years back to create an end-to-end system that acts essentially as Shell’s order management system; local subsidiaries submit their orders into Bloomberg, and it feeds through to the FX teams in London and Singapore to route it externally as they see fit.

“They can submit to us and it comes into a central blotter in Bloomberg. Some is automated, but for others we can choose to algo it, RFQ it, stream it, or pick up the phone if we wanted to,” he says.

“That ability to manage with fewer systems is important to us; the control it gives us, the governance it gives us, and the chance of errors or missing transactions is significantly reduced because it’s all within one environment,” he adds.

For super-liquid pairs such as euro/US dollar they hit streaming prices on Bloomberg, hitting the best prices as and when they need it.

“It’s effectively like having a human algo – someone who sits and hits the offer when they’re buying,” he says.

Most emerging markets pairs are liquid enough to be done via request-for-quote on Bloomberg, but Dawson says if the spreads are really wide it becomes a conversation with relationship banks about what good execution looks like.

Shell has 25 relationship banks across a diverse range of countries to ensure it can access liquidity in developed markets and more niche emerging ones.

“It is a competitive business. Sometimes one that wins a lot of business this month may not next month – risk appetites change. But that ability to have 25 very, very strong banks providing liquidity to the Shell group is important to us,” he says.

### Coping with Covid

The rise in volatility in March as a result of the coronavirus did not tempt the company to change its hedging strategy.

Shell’s strategy is based around a constant assessment of what its best execution method is. If liquidity was low for a pair, for instance, it might be more aggressive to ensure it gets a fill, or instead use RFQ or risk transfer.

The company certainly didn’t shy away from passive algos, though. Dawson says the reduction in liquidity meant the treasury team was taking slightly more market risk when using passive algos, but it was relatively insignificant. Algos were still able to fill in a timely manner, he says.

“We have the data, but then we also have people who are close to markets who can understand this and manage it in an effective way. And as liquidity conditions change, we have to be reactive to it, but that’s the case for all market events. Clearly Covid-19 was a much larger one,” says Dawson.

The treasury team started working from home in mid-March, but the move was seamless as each member was already working from home one day a month as part of the company’s existing business continuity plan.

“Actually, it has been extremely successful. The ability to go and work remotely and have access to all systems worked on day one. We were ready to go,” he says.

### Swaps shop

Shell is also active in FX swaps, again trading hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth a year. It uses them for two reasons, with the first being for intergroup funding – if a local subsidiary needed local currency, Shell’s FX treasury would borrow the currency from the FX swap market and lend it to the local entity.

The other reason is to manage day-to-day cashflows when the company is long or short different currencies. The swaps tend to be short dated, generally 90 days or less, with some being overnight.

Again, all its swaps are executed electronically on Bloomberg: “Gone are the days of picking up the phone, and unless it’s very, very bespoke, virtually everything is done by platform,” says Dawson.

While the swaps for cashflow management are a bit more ad hoc, the intergroup funding trades are generally regular. That means it’s a possible candidate for using emerging platforms like peer-to-peer venue FX HedgePool, which seeks to match off regular monthly swaps flow between users to minimise the amount they have to do in the market.

Dawson says the treasury team is keeping an eye on its development but isn’t in any rush to get involved: “We are watching. We’ve had some conversations, and I think it will be interesting to see where the market goes in this space, but it’s not something that we have deeply explored at this stage,” he says.

One of the big drawcards of peer-to-peer is that it allows firms struggling with credit line limits at the dealers to diversify their exposures. But given Shell’s high credit rating – it has an AA- long term rating from S&P – and the fact the company been posting daily variation margin on its non-cleared interest rate and FX derivatives since March 2017, credit lines are not an issue.

### Supporting better governance

The past few years have seen a big focus on governance in the FX markets, with the development of the FX Global Code, and the writing of various broader market standards by groups overseen by the Financial Market Standards Board (FMSB).

Shell has been keen to get involved in this area, taking part in the development of the global code, of which it was one of the first corporate adherents. Corporate treasuries have been notable laggards when it comes to signing up to the code, though. Of the 1,051 entities that have signed up as of August 25, only 26 were corporates.

Dawson says education is the key to getting more interest from these firms, and this can be helped along by industry bodies, and through general conversations they have with peers. He requires all Shell’s liquidity providers (LPs) to have signed the code if they want to trade, and while it’s unlikely banks would require the same, he thinks it’s an important thing to do to improve market integrity.

“Good behaviours are good for markets as a whole. We want them to be fair and effective markets. And we think that is good for our go-to-market strategy, because better behaviours are good for all,” he says.

Dawson is also chairing an FMSB group writing standards around the execution of large trades in fixed income, currency and commodity markets. After the slew of court cases around FX market governance in recent years, none of which involved Shell, Dawson says the topic is a huge focus on the sell side. He says responsibilities are now much more clearly understood by all market participants and disclosures have improved.

Other changes are more intangible. Anecdotally, though, Dawson says the level of governance the LPs have imposed upon themselves has increased, with dealers explaining new internal restrictions and the location of new Chinese walls, for example.

“Quite frequently, what we’re finding is that a lot of the banks have already moved forward with this and have strong standards in place following the kind of the stories that we’ve all seen,” he says.
