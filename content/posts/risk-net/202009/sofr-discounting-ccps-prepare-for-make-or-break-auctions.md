{{< quote steelblue >}}_Deluge of one-way risk and kinks in basis swap auctions could derail Libor transition milestone_{{< /quote >}}

The US dollar swap market is preparing for what could be a momentous weekend in mid-October.

That is when CME and LCH will change the risk-free rate they use to value and pay interest on cash collateral for $134 trillion of cleared US dollar swaps. The so-called ‘big bang’, set to take place between October 16 and 19, will see the effective federal funds rate replaced with the secured overnight financing rate, or SOFR – the Federal Reserve’s preferred successor to US dollar Libor.

The two-step process for executing the move is complex and fraught with pitfalls.

Switching the rate used to discount future cashflows and calculate price alignment interest (PAI) will change the net present value (NPV) of cleared portfolios. To square the winners and losers, the central counterparties will make a one-off cash adjustment to swapholder accounts.

The changeover will also alter the discount risk sensitivity of cleared portfolios. This will be addressed via a distribution of SOFR/Fed funds basis swaps, which some participants will offload at auctions planned by both CCPs.

This re-hedging and auction step is where the potential dangers lurk.

An anticipated deluge of one-sided risk in the auctions has already pushed the [SOFR/Fed funds basis to historic wides at the long end](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7661211/sofr-basis-blows-out-amid-ccp-discounting-changes). Some strategists warn the imbalance could translate into off-market pricing, or scupper the auctions altogether. “There could be a lot of volatility around the auctions given that no one other than dealers really hedges discount risk,” says a rates strategist at a US bank. “There’s a real risk that markets turn one-sided in this endeavour.”

The possibility of the auctions failing cannot be discounted. This could happen if one-sided flow pushes prices off-market, or if the expected netting benefits fail to materialise. Or there may simply not be enough bids to unwind the portfolios.

Differences in the timing and optionality of the auctions at the two CCPs add another layer of complexity. After a “tabletop exercise” in June, members of a subgroup of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Market Risk Advisory Committee warned these technical discrepancies created “significant operational and market risk” for participants.

All accounts at CME will receive mandatory basis swaps at the start of the process, which they can unwind via an auction at the end. LCH allows non-members to opt out of the basis swaps entirely. The unwanted positions will be auctioned at the start of the process, with the clearing price applied to all basis swaps, regardless of whether firms receive or opt out of them.

Some rates traders say CME’s approach is riskier. “It’s functionally the same, but there is a difference between taking the swap and unwinding it, or never getting it in the first place,” says a rates trader at a US bank. “In the CME case, you can have a P&L impact if you unwind at a different price. Whereas with LCH it never touches your books, so there’s no mark-to-market.”

A derivatives trader at a US insurer agrees. “The CME is making a potential mistake by holding the auction on Monday rather on Friday to determine what the compensating values and resulting basis swaps should be,” the trader says. “There’s a risk you’re going to give everyone basis swaps SOFR plus five on Friday, and then the markets tell you the price of that swap is SOFR plus eight [on Monday]. That means you compensate everyone three basis points different versus where the market actually clears.”

Even so, analysts say the chances of a “hard failure” – in which there aren’t enough bids to absorb unwanted basis swap positions – are remote. But a “soft failure” – where the auction delivers an off-market price – remains a real possibility.

David Horner, head of risk at LCH Swapclear, acknowledges the auctions may not satisfy everyone. “The process is designed so there will be a conclusive outcome no matter what happens with auction bids, which means a partial fill or even no fill is a possibility,” says Horner. “We think there should be efficiencies in a centralised close-out process but people may prefer to close out the swaps on the open market.”

The stakes are certainly high. The stewards of the US dollar Libor transition are counting on the discounting switch to cement SOFR’s standing in the market and catalyse liquidity in derivatives linked to the new rate. Any slip-ups could seriously derail or set back that effort.

“Technical though it may be, this is the most effective mechanism by which we facilitate and encourage trading in derivatives tied to SOFR for the market as a whole, so it’s very important it goes well,” says Joshua Younger, interest rate strategist at JP Morgan. “To meet all the timelines for benchmark reform, this has to work. If it doesn’t, we’re at risk of having to delay those timelines to avoid a more disorderly transition.” (see box: Liquidity tonic?)

### One-way sign

A simpler version of the discounting switch has already taken place in European markets. In a co-ordinated effort on July 27, LCH, CME and Eurex changed the discount rate for euro-denominated swaps from Eonia to the new euro short-term rate, or €STR, without hitch or fanfare. But the fixed 8.5bp spread between the two European rates meant only a cash adjustment – the simplest part of the dollar switch – was needed.

“The fact that Europe went well doesn’t necessarily help inform us about this process given the lack of any use of basis swaps,” says JP Morgan’s Younger. “The basis swap element is really the issue here. Avoiding value transfer is very straightforward because there is no opting in or opting out – it’s just a zero-sum game.”

The complexity stems from the moving basis between SOFR and Fed funds. This means switching from one to the other will change the discount rate sensitivity of swap portfolios. To restore the original risk profile, LCH and CME will issue SOFR/Fed funds basis swaps to client accounts.

For dealers, this is a zero-cost way to shift discount risk hedges to the new rate. But for many end-users, it could be more of a headache than a remedy. Some client accounts are unable to hold basis swaps on their books, while others simply don’t hedge discount risk and have no need for them.

The CCPs will help end-users to offload unwanted basis swaps in centralised auctions, where netting benefits should reduce the cost of unwinding them.

JP Morgan’s Younger estimates there is $100 million per basis point of net dollar discounting risk in the clearing houses. On September 11, the basis between SOFR and Fed funds swaps ranged between -0.44bp in two-year maturities to 7.86bp in 30-year tenors, according to Bloomberg. That means the dollars at risk should be under $500 million, absent an unexpected basis spike.

The problem is that most of the sellers in the auction are likely to be facing the same direction.

Asset liability managers are by far the biggest holders of longer-dated receive-fixed swaps. Many of these investors cannot hold basis swaps on their books under their derivatives use plans and are expected to dump them in the auctions. Those positions are expected to be sizeable. Longer-dated receive-fixed trades moved deeply in-the-money following the emergency rate cuts earlier this year. This left asset liability managers heavily exposed to discounting risk, meaning they will receive a hefty volume of compensating swaps.

The allocation of basis swaps depends on the NPV of portfolios. Those with positive NPV – such as insurers and pension funds – will be compensated with receive SOFR/pay Fed funds basis swaps. These so-called tighteners gain in value as the gap between the two rates narrows. Portfolios with negative NPV will get wideners – pay SOFR/receive Fed funds basis swaps. The more extreme the NPV, the higher the volume of basis swaps received.

These compensating swaps will be provided by LCH as a pair of fixed versus floating OIS swaps – one referencing SOFR and the opposite trade referencing Fed funds. CME is giving users a choice to take basis swaps or paired fix-float OIS swaps.

Recent moves in the 30-year SOFR/Fed funds basis, which has more than tripled to over 7bp in the past three months, suggests the market expects the auction to be flooded with basis tighteners from holders of receive-fixed swaps. Pay-fixed accounts such as banks and asset managers – which would typically have negative NPV and offsetting basis positions – are unlikely to offset this flow.

### Structural differences

The way the auctions are structured could also have a big bearing on the outcome.

LCH will allow non-member clients to opt out of basis swaps altogether and take a cash payment in lieu of the instruments. It set a September 4 deadline for firms to confirm their intentions. The unwanted basis swaps will be netted down and the balance auctioned on Friday, October 16. The clearing price in the auction, determined by a 10-minute bidding window around 9.30am EST for each of the six tenors, will be applied to all compensation.

Younger says this approach makes sense. “The theoretically sound way to do this is to use the auction to set pricing for all the swaps, whether they’re delivered or placed at auction. It has the advantage of not resulting in any immediate mark-to-market for one set of swaps versus another,” he says. “If you conduct the auction second, the question is at what price did you deliver the mandatory and the auctioned swaps? If there’s a difference, it could be quite disruptive because the message is that the market isn’t where we thought it was. That’s a particularly acute risk in markets which don’t trade very frequently or in large size.”

This is the main concern some have with CME’s plans. The US clearing house will auction unwanted swaps in a single 30-minute auction on Monday, October 19 – three days after the distribution of cash compensation and mandatory basis swaps, which will be priced using a reference curve. That means sellers in the auction are exposed to market moves in the interim and may book a P&L loss. This is limited to a maximum loss threshold, which, if exceeded, would cause the auction to fail.

CME recognises the risk, but says separating the auction from the distribution means the entire switch is not contingent on the success of the auction. “We view this as a key benefit of CME’s transition process, as the transition has a greater certainty of success and ensures that the impact of the transition is neutralised through the cash and risk compensation,” says Sunhil Cutinho, president of CME Clearing.

### Futile exercise

The two CCPs are also taking very different stances on disclosure.

Market participants will get their first hint of the direction and magnitude of LCH’s auction on September 18, when it releases initial portfolio indications based on confirmed opt-outs.

“It removes one important unknown, which is the population of accounts opting out. But some uncertainty will remain up to the auction,” says LCH’s Horner.

“Discounting risk is a dynamic risk, so it moves with the level of rates,” he says. “People can also make adjustments such as portfolio transfers or re-couponing. This is just an indicative portfolio to give a feeling of size and direction, but it could change as time goes by.”

More information will be provided on October 1 before the final positions are locked in on October 14.

CME is holding its cards closer to its chest. Swapholders have until October 2 to decide whether to keep the basis swaps or ditch them at auction. There are no plans to publish the size or direction of the portfolio prior to the auction. The size of the portfolio will be divulged to bidders under a non-disclosure agreement. The direction will remain a secret and will only be revealed to auction winners.

The CCP will ask participating dealers to make two-way prices referencing the real portfolio and a synthetic mirror image. This is intended to protect clients who may need to unwind swaps in the bilateral market in the event of an auction failure.

“Masking of the direction of the auction portfolio is necessary to protect the auction winners and the participating customers in case the auction is not executed,” says CME’s Coutinho.

Some see this as a futile exercise as the shape of the portfolio is unlikely to be materially different from that announced by LCH.

“More of the actual end-user activity is done in CME, so may not be something that can be fully extrapolated, but what happens at LCH is going to give a good indication of what to expect,” says a trader at one US house.

CME says participants should not draw conclusions from the LCH announcement. “While LCH and CME may have common participants, we do not believe that LCH’s announcement of the direction of its auction portfolio on September 18 will provide any insight or information on CME’s auction portfolio,” says a spokesperson.

### Winners curse

The desire to keep things under wraps doesn’t stop there. CME is also seeking relief from real-time reporting requirements. It says this is “necessary and appropriate” to incentivise multiple firms to participate as auction bidders.

“Absent such relief, CME is concerned that firms may be unwilling to participate as auction bidders or may not bid as aggressively if information about their transactions will be disclosed publicly,” says Coutinho.

That request is causing disquiet among some buy-side firms.

“Transition to SOFR is predicated by the need for a more transparent benchmark and that same principle of transparency should apply to the transition steps we’re taking as well,” said Stephen Berger, global head of government and regulatory policy at Citadel, speaking at the CFTC’s Market Risk Advisory Committee meeting in July.

He worries an exemption could lead to “information asymmetries” where secondary market transactions are subject to post-trade transparency rules, while activity in the auction is kept in the dark.

Dealers are siding with CME on this. They argue that too much transparency when auctioning a large directional portfolio could expose bidders to a “winners curse”, where they are left stranded with the positions, and result in less competitive pricing.

“I think the goal here if they were to get relief would be to ensure the dealers could bid more aggressively – and that should be in the interest of the buy side – by not being afraid that whoever wins will be stuck with a position that’s impossible to unwind at reasonable level,” says a rates trader at a second US house. “If there’s prudential relief, it would be from public reporting. Private reporting to the authorities would happen regardless.”

This is particularly relevant for CME’s auction, which could rely on a single winner to take down the entire position. It could employ a so-called Dutch auction, where the bidding starts at a high asking price and is then reduced down to a level where the last part of the portfolio can be cleared, while a smaller portfolio could be auctioned on a winner-takes-all basis where the best price wins the full portfolio. CME will determine the auction style once the size of the portfolio is known.

LCH has already secured participation from 18 dealers for its auction. Bidders are being asked to provide tradeable quotes for at least 10% of each tenor on offer and can also enter an all-or-nothing price. The best price to clear the full portfolio based on partial bids would then be compared to the best all-or-nothing price to determine whether the swap goes to one or multiple winners. “We think we’ve sourced the vast majority of the available liquidity, but we’ve got other protections in the design,” says Horner. “An auction cap will prevent a really off-market price from being realised, which should give customers some confidence.”

There are other reasons to be confident. The euro discounting switch was a success and many of the lessons learned in June are being applied to the SOFR switch. For example, LCH users have been able to view their end-of-day discount calculations since March, allowing them to see on a daily basis a combination of their cash and basis swap compensation. The auction platform has been tested with external participants and a number of fire drills are anticipated before the event.

“It has been a good advert for central clearing, because you couldn’t have done that bilaterally. That kind of an exercise hasn’t been done before, so to be able to do something that’s so efficient for hundreds of accounts and thousands of trades, I think it’s a good outcome for the market,” says Horner.

Guillaume Helie, chief operating officer for Libor transition in the global markets business at Goldman Sachs, agrees. He sees the discounting switch in October as a much-needed test of the market’s readiness for Libor’s eventual discontinuation, which would trigger fallback clauses that will automatically flip US dollar Libor swaps to SOFR.

“Ahead of year-end 2021, when the industry needs to be ready to implement fallbacks, the discounting switch is the only real test of operational readiness,” says Helie. “I think that it’s a healthy exercise as it allows institutions to stress test their preparedness and adjust their plans accordingly for the real “big bang”, the cessation of Libor.”

### Liquidity tonic?
Libor transition officials in the US clearly hope the discounting switch will boost trading in derivatives linked to the secured overnight financing rate.

Analysts are not so sure.

Joshua Younger, interest rate strategist at JP Morgan, says the discounting switch may be exactly the shot in the arm the SOFR derivatives market requires.

“To generate liquidity in a new derivatives product, you need to give people a reason not just to use SOFR derivatives but to use them actively and trade them around so there’s sufficient transaction activity to make reasonably tight markets. The way you do that is by creating a population of non-derivatives assets or liabilities that are large and dynamic in their risk. The useful thing about discounting risk is that there’s nothing more convex than the P&L associated with existing positions,” he says.

“What we’re doing here is generating very large exposures held by dealers who are sensitive to small deviations in discounting risk. Everyone’s positions can be changing a lot as rates move around, so you not only have to build up a large stock of SOFR-linked hedges, you also have to rebalance those hedges frequently.”

Others aren’t convinced. Outside the dealer community, few firms hedge their discounting risk. SOFR’s lack of a credit sensitivity has also kept borrowers and lenders on the sidelines.

“The adjustment will develop SOFR liquidity as far as dealer hedging is concerned but it’s not necessarily going to result in a shift in behaviour from the real money community, and there may not be a material jump and SOFR-related derivatives liquidity beyond what is currently being done in the Fed funds market,” says a rates strategist at another US bank.

“Until Libor is definitively going away, and until you start to see lending products shift, I don’t think we’re going to see a material tick-up.”

There’s a long way to go. At LCH – the largest US dollar swaps clearing house – cleared SOFR swaps notional totals just $1.22 trillion, compared to $50 trillion of cleared US dollar Libor swaps notional.

So far, there is [no evidence of a liquidity shift in euro markets](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7661206/slump-in-eustr-swap-volumes-at-lch-leaves-market-guessing) since the cleared euro swap discounting rate flipped from Eonia to €STR. LCH cleared just €65 billion ($77 billion) of €STR swaps in August – the first full month following the switch – down on the previous two months.

In part, this reflects the fixed basis between the two euro overnight rates, meaning users can still view Eonia risk as €STR minus 8.5 basis points.

“I think the Fed funds one is different, and intuitively, it should be more of a boost to activity because Fed funds and SOFR are not co-dependent,” says Horner.
