{{< quote steelblue >}}_Democrats and some lawyers say Tarbert’s new principles don’t achieve same goals as Reg AT_{{< /quote >}}

Lawyers and former staff of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission say the recent withdrawal of a long-debated regulation covering algorithmic trading is a “surprising” step, which could delay any plans the agency might have to revive it if Joe Biden is elected president in November.

One former senior staffer at the CFTC says the scrapping of Reg AT, originally proposed under Democrat chairman Timothy Massad in 2012, would prevent a future CFTC chair from proceeding directly and immediately to finalise the rule after the presidential and congressional elections.

Julian Hammar, a partner at law firm FisherBroyles, agrees with this interpretation: “If a Democratic administration were elected, a Commission under it might want to take such direct action…. Instead they would have to re-propose it.”

At an open meeting on June 25, current CFTC chair Heath Tarbert proposed withdrawing Reg AT, and tabled a new draft rule on electronic trading risk principles. Although Democrat commissioner Dan Berkovitz supported presenting the new principles for consultation, both he and his fellow Democrat commissioner Rostin Behnam objected strongly to the withdrawal of Reg AT. Behnam also dissented from Tarbert’s new proposed principles.

Behnam warned that a “dangerous precedent” has been set by voting to withdraw the prior commission’s proposed rule, particularly one that had received unanimous assent.

“I have followed in a tradition of some of my predecessors on the Commission, at times voting for proposals that I would not have supported as final rules, for the purpose of advancing the conversation,” he said, adding: “I worry that the withdrawal of Reg AT could lead to future withdrawals of Commission proposals, and a loss of this historical collegiality.”

The former CFTC staffer agrees that Reg AT’s withdrawal is procedurally “surprising” and “unusual”, representing a break from informal rulemaking convention.

“I don’t recall it happening in at least 12 years. Chairman Massad would not have withdrawn any of chairman Gensler’s proposals, and chairman Giancarlo did not withdraw any of his predecessor’s proposals.”

Withdrawing a prior commission’s proposal had been conventionally viewed as unnecessary, the former staffer adds: “Under the Administrative Procedure Act, once the new proposal is adopted, it becomes more difficult for any future regime to adopt the oldest proposal on the table without addressing anything that followed.”

Berkovitz said at the June open meeting that the withdrawal indicated a belief that there was nothing of value in the draft Reg AT, which he argued is “simply not true”.

Hammar concurs that the original industry responses did not condemn every aspect of Reg AT. “There were disagreements on aspects, which is common in rulemaking… but it was not universally perceived to be all bad.”

However, Tarbert defended the move as non-partisan, pointing to a framework for principles and rule-based regulation he had authored and published in the [Harvard Business Law Review](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8183-20) on June 15, 2020, adding that he would withdraw rules proposed under both Republican and Democrat chairs if they meet the criteria laid out.

“If we don’t plan on finalising it and we have to re-propose it, even if we want to finalise aspects of it, then my view is I will put it before the commission to withdraw, so we have a clean slate,” Tarbert said at the open meeting.

Longstanding critics of Reg AT are sympathetic to Tarbert’s stance. Some had argued Reg AT might contravene intellectual property law protecting firms’ trading algorithms, so the problems with it were potentially fundamental enough to justify its withdrawal.

“It was an extraordinary proposal that seemed to me to be divorced from any statutory authority and went beyond what a comparable regulator [the Securities and Exchange Commission] requires. Those seem to be very problematic criticisms, so that aspect of the requirements was withdrawn in light of public comments and a change in who the regulators were,” says Steven Lofchie, a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.

Lofchie contends that the act of withdrawing the rule simply represents business-as-usual and reflects successive chairs’ philosophical differences in their approach to regulation – specifically, Tarbert’s principles-based approach versus earlier, more prescriptive rulemaking. “I don’t see anything extraordinary about the withdrawal,” he says.

### Miracle of brevity

Proposed rules are frequently withdrawn, Hammar agrees, but are usually reproposed with rules addressing the same issue. “The unusualness of it, I think, stems from the fact that Reg AT and the proposed rule on electronic trading risk principles that the CFTC issued cover different subject matter,” he adds.

The notice of proposed rulemaking on the principles states that they “accomplish a similar goal” to Reg AT, but the dissenting Democrat commissioners argue the two rules substantially differ. Moreover, Hammar points out that the electronic trading risk principles are not logically inconsistent with Reg AT, and were not specified as the reason for its withdrawal. Indeed, commissioner Berkovitz supported consulting on the principles, while opposing the withdrawal of Reg AT.

Reg AT, proposed in the wake of the May 2010 flash crash in the US stock market, sought to address fears around the practice of automated or algorithmic trading. The proposal underwent two rounds of heated public comment in 2015 and 2016, and was widely [criticised](https://www.waterstechnology.com/trading-tools/2474670/reg-ats-source-code-rule-still-striking-a-nerve) for a provision that would require firms to hand over proprietary source code to the regulator, claiming it would undermine intellectual property rights.

As its name suggests, the proposed electronic trading risk principles lay out three tenets for risk management that aim to capture risks that have developed since the electronification of markets. In large part, it recognises progress made by individual exchanges to manage these evolving risks while allowing flexibility to cover future, unknown electronic trading risks.

The principles require exchanges to prevent, detect and mitigate market disruptions and system anomalies associated with electronic trading; implement exchange-based pre-trade risk controls for electronic orders; and promptly notify the CFTC of any significant disruptions to electronic trading.

“We’re codifying what we see as some of the practices across the industry to help ensure, on a principles basis, consistency in risk management,” Dorothy DeWitt, director of the CFTC’s division of market oversight, tells Risk.net.

Andrew Ridenour, special counsel to chairman Tarbert, adds that the exchanges will be best positioned to determine what needs to change according to their individual risk control framework and business profile.

Reg AT, by contrast, would also have set pre-trade risk controls at the firm or futures commission merchant level, in addition to at exchanges. The Democrats argue the new proposal’s breadth is stretched to the point of meaningless and does little to address specific issues pertaining to automated trading and only partially addresses electronic trading risk.

“Today’s proposed principles are all of three sentences long. This is not a miracle of brevity. It just shows that the proposal today does not really do anything – while paradoxically writing the Commission a blank check to change its mind about what the principles mean in the future,” Behnam wrote in his dissenting statement.

Ridenour dismisses concerns that the rule does not mandate specific oversight, saying the CFTC will continue to be “a part of the conversation as the exchanges are addressing the problems that they face”. He adds: “We have a degree of mutual trust with our exchanges. The exchanges, by and large, do this [risk management] already because it is in everyone’s interest.”

### More clarity needed

The comment period for the proposed principles closed on August 24. Democrat concerns were echoed by public interest lobby group Better Markets in its response to the consultation. It noted that the principles address only a narrow set of electronic trading risks on exchanges, such as pre-trade risks associated with electronic point-and-click trading and so-called “fat finger” errors.

Better Markets also highlighted the absence of provisions for risks around electronic order origination, programming, transmission and execution, critical market infrastructure, order management, and trading issues and practices, all of which were covered by the withdrawn Reg AT.

The lobby group was also sceptical that the rule was able to codify or require adoption of best practices, and noted that it does not mandate a survey of existing policies, procedures and controls. Better Markets even suggested the vagueness of the proposed principles, and their duplication of existing rules, implies they were drafted merely as a pretext for withdrawing Reg AT.

Steve Suppan, policy director at the Institute for Agricultural Trade Policy (IATP), shares that scepticism, and says the proposal falls short of rulemaking best practice: “There are so many basic features of rulemaking that are absent from this preliminary notice, there’s no indication of a statutory analysis – that’s Regulation 101.”

DeWitt says the CFTC is currently able to identify best practices as they develop, but sharing this insight between exchanges that may be competitors “would get a little bit more difficult.”

More to the point, DeWitt says, this is not the commission’s objective: “We’re specifically trying to avoid the situation where we’re mandating for particular types of controls or rules,” she says.

Responses from market participants generally supported the less prescriptive approach of the principles compared with Reg AT, but they did flag up a significant number of points that need clarifying due to the very brief nature of the current proposal. One is quite fundamental: whether “electronic trading” only refers to exchanges’ central limit order books, or if it includes other formats such as block trades.

Exchanges also want to know how to define “significant disruptions” that must be reported to the CFTC, and questioned why the proposal was only being applied to them, not to other venues such as swap execution facilities or foreign boards of trade.

CME Group’s response, at 18 pages, was far larger than the CFTC proposal itself. Like Better Markets, CME noted that there are substantial elements of duplication with existing CFTC rules, and questioned the essential purpose of the draft principles.

“Either electronic trading involves risks requiring further CFTC regulation, or it does not. If it does, the Commission should propose regulations that treat all electronic trading platforms comparably,” CME Group’s response concluded.
