The Dutch Authority for Financial Markets is calling on the European Union to straighten out a perceived imbalance in its trading and transparency rules – a move that could lead to certain technology providers being regulated as trading venues.

“This is one of the key priorities for the AFM – to ensure a level playing field between all types of multilateral systems and make sure they are regulated as such if they are within the definition,” says Matthijs Geneste, a supervisor for market infrastructure with the Dutch regulator, in an exclusive interview with Risk.net.

The second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ([Mifid II](https://www.risk.net/topics/markets-in-financial-instruments-directive-mifid)) defines three types of trading venue: regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) and organised trading facilities (OTFs). Any investment firm or market operator running a platform that meets [one of these definitions](https://www.risk.net/regulation/mifid/4357061/identity-crisis-venues-still-struggle-with-mifid-designations) must seek a licence from its local regulator – and adhere to the rules laid out in [Mifid II](https://www.risk.net/topics/markets-in-financial-instruments-directive-mifid) and its accompanying regulation, Mifir.

Trading venues, however, say some technology vendors that aggregate prices on MTFs to create electronic order books are flouting the rules. They claim these firms operate as de facto trading venues without being subject to the same rules, putting regulated platforms at a [competitive disadvantage](https://www.risk.net/investing/markets/7338271/trading-venues-decry-disruptors-as-mtf-battle-heats-up).

A number of UK-based MTFs – including those operated by Bloomberg, Cboe, CME’s BrokerTec, TP Icap’s i-Swap, MarketAxess and Tradeweb – have established post-Brexit entities in Amsterdam from which to handle their EU clients. They seem to have found an ally in the AFM, which is calling for additional regulatory guidance and a legislative change to address the issue.

“The most important thing we can do within Esma [the European Securities and Markets Authority] and as NCAs [national competent authorities] is to provide the necessary clarity and guidance and also ensure a certain degree of supervisory convergence and a level playing field in Europe,” says Geneste.

At the heart of the debate is the term ‘multilateral system’, which is defined under EU rules as any system or facility in which multiple third-party buying and selling interests can interact with one another.

Article 1(7) of Mifid II states that all multilateral systems in financial instruments must operate as MTFs, OTFs or regulated markets.

But a recital, or introductory paragraph, in Mifir states that facilities where there is no genuine trade execution or arrangement taking place should not be classified as trading venues.

Technology vendors argue they merely enable [bilateral discussions](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6933016/esma-probes-blurred-line-between-fx-vendors-and-venues) between parties – or simply distribute data – and don’t operate multilateral systems.

Geneste says any inconsistency in the texts should be straightened out. “If you are within the boundaries of article 1(7), then that should be clear enough,” he says.

He suggests the OTF classification may be appropriate for vendors. The category was created as a catch-all for future types of trading venue, as innovation continues to create different means of matching buyers and sellers.

### OTF changes afoot?

Differences between OTFs and other venue classifications include the fact that OTFs are only able to trade non-equity instruments. There are otherwise fewer limitations on the type of activities OTFs may undertake – such as matched principal trading. OTF operators must also play an active role in bringing about transactions.

“The OTF [definition] was specifically created to try and capture some types of systems that would fall between different stools – so to speak,” says Geneste. “We also appreciate the regulatory burden of becoming a licensed trading venue is high, so we are also thinking about that.”

The issue is already on the European Commission’s radar. A consultation paper, released by the legislator in February this year, states some trading venues had expressed concerns about an emerging trend of alternative types of electronic platforms.

Esma is also preparing a consultation paper, scheduled to be released this month. According to Geneste, it will ask questions on the scope of multilateral systems. This could provide an opportunity to reconsider the classification of the new price aggregation services provided by technology vendors.

“The OTF report Esma is currently working on will include some broader questions on the scope of multilateral systems because this has been an ongoing discussion,” says Geneste. “What we are trying to do is to explain things better and ask for feedback on why [the current legislation] is not clear.”

Esma did not confirm in time for publication of this article whether the consultation paper will ask questions on the regulatory boundary for the definition of trading venues.

The AFM is also seeking legislative changes to ensure a consistent interpretation across the EU. In an AFM position paper, published on August 27, the supervisor recommends inserting article 1(7) of Mifid II into Mifir to ensure a consistent interpretation of the rule.

Under EU law, directives written by the bloc’s legislators are transposed into national laws, which can lead to member states implementing and interpreting rules differently. Regulations, on the other hand, apply directly to member states, so there is less room for difference in interpretation between EU countries.

The proposed changes could be made during an anticipated comprehensive review of Mifid II, which is expected to launch next year.
