Traders are expecting Chinese renminbi foreign exchange swap and forward volumes to increase if the country’s bonds are added to a key fixed income index this week.

Concerns about secondary market liquidity, FX execution and settlement have kept Chinese government bonds (CGBs) out of the FTSE Russell World Government Bond Index (WGBI) until now. But with the instruments tipped to make the grade in an annual review on September 24, market participants believe the use of renminbi swaps and forwards will rise as a result.

“I think it’s reasonable to say FX hedging – swap and forward – will increase,” says Patrick Wu, head of emerging markets for Asia at Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.

Passive asset managers need to buy the underlying to track the various indexes, and for markets such as China, these are often financed by exchanging US dollars for onshore or offshore renminbi in the FX swap market.

An FX head at one large asset manager says most investors do not hedge their emerging markets portfolios due to the high costs involved, but it’s a different story if they are included in a developed market index like the WGBI. This is because FTSE Russell offers currency-hedged versions of the WGBI calculated using one-month FX forwards that are rolled every month. Asset managers would need to trade the same forwards to minimise tracking errors.

Including CGBs in the index will attract many different investors to the market for the first time, says Hayden Briscoe, head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at UBS Asset Management. Such inflows will bring more activity in renminbi FX swaps besides the dominant USD/CNY pair.

“I have conversations with Italian clients, German clients, UK clients, and they’re all starting to make allocations into Chinese bonds for the first time. There is a huge amount of activity going on,” says Briscoe. “In our fund, we used to just have US dollar and euro hedged into CNY. Now we’ve got sterling, Swiss francs,” he says.

“For these other currencies, people have started to convert their foreign currency to CNY and invest in the Chinese bonds market for the first time,” adds Briscoe.

The WGBI wouldn’t be the first developed market index to add CGBs – the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index added Chinese government and policy bank securities in April 2019 – but it would be one of the largest.

Their inclusion is widely expected in the market following China’s moves to allow foreign investors to [access FX hedging onshore](https://www.fx-markets.com/trading/7566586/rmb-hedging-comes-onshore-as-regulators-liberalise-fx-market) and to [update its bond settlement system](http://www.chinamoney.com.cn/chinese/scggbbscggscggtz/20200916/1778795.html#cp=scggbbscgg) to facilitate foreign investors.

“It’s very likely that the WGBI will include China this month. In the past 12 months, the Chinese regulators have answered most of the requests from foreign investors,” says Crédit Agricole’s Wu.

A Goldman Sachs note earlier this month estimated there were around $2.5 trillion of assets tracking the WGBI. The inclusion of CGBs in the index could draw an additional $140 billion into the country’s bonds, says Wu, assuming a weighting of 5.7% and a 21-month phase-in period.

Inclusion in other indexes and competitive yields compared to developed markets has seen holdings of CGBs by foreign investors rise steadily since the start of 2017. According to a FTSE Russell [report](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/ftse_russell_china_bond_report_211119_final_0.pdf) in November last year, roughly 8.5% of CGBs were held by foreign investors as of September 2019. Wu says adding the bonds to the WGBI will only increase interest in them.

“That’s one of the most important milestones, because most of the indexes have already included CGBs and the WGBI inclusion will take it to a full scale of shift. And the spread between 10-year CGBs and US Treasury at 240 basis points is very attractive,” he says.

“The steepness of the bond curve in China is also very attractive for asset managers,” he adds.

While foreign investors might use FX swaps to finance the purchases they are unlikely to hedge the currency risk, says Stephen Chiu, FX and rates strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.

“Hedging with FX swaps now comes with an annualised cost of 2.5%, while a full hedge might lower China's 10-year yield to 1%,” says Chiu.
