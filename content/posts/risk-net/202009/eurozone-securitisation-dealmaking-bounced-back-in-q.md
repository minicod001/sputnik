Sales of securitised loans to special-purpose entities (SPEs) revved up in the second quarter, having dried up earlier this year with the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.

Data from the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pdf/fvc/ecb.fvcs20q2_annex~63ff6919ce.en.pdf?d87b1271cc67baba9315d14fe45baa6e) (ECB) shows that net purchases of loans by eurozone SPEs, referred to as financial vehicle corporations, amounted to €16 billion ($19.1 billion) over Q2. The prior quarter, SPEs sold a net €7 billion of loans.

Eurozone bank loans were the most popular choice last quarter. Net purchases hit €19.2 billion, following net sales of €14.9 billion in Q1. The second quarter’s buying binge was the biggest since Q3 2015. Purchases of loans originated by non-bank financial institutions also increased, with a net €3.3 billion bought in Q2.

On the flipside, SPEs were net sellers of €5.1 billion of loans originated by non-eurozone entities, as well as €1.3 billion of loans made by eurozone non-financial institutions.

Total loan holdings of eurozone SPEs were €1.28 trillion as of end-June, down less than 1% on Q1, and flat year-on-year.

### What is it?

The European Central Bank (ECB) [publishes statistics](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/financial_corporations/financial_vehicle_corporations/html/index.en.html) on the assets, liabilities and transaction flows of eurozone financial vehicle corporations engaged in securitisation activities.

### Why it matters

Risky [leveraged loans](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7272461/leveraged-loan-risks-concentrated-in-handful-of-banks-fsb) had been eyed with suspicion by regulators before the coronavirus crisis, precisely because they were seen as likely to default in an economic downturn.

With the outbreak of the pandemic, the market for new leveraged loans ground to a halt and outstanding obligations collapsed in value. It was against this backdrop that SPEs became net sellers of bank loans in Q1. It may be that securitisation vehicles held on to good quality loans while offloading those that looked ripe to implode to distressed debt investors.

Though the economic outlook for the eurozone remains murky, the securitisation pipeline appears to be building up again. It could be that those banks which held off from selling loans in Q1 because of the market panic offloaded them en masse in Q2. Another factor could be banks wanting to get rid of loans from their balance sheet that look as though they will sour through the course of the coronavirus recession.
