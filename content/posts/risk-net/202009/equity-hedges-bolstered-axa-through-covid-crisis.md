French insurer Axa’s first half earnings got a boost from a portfolio of equity derivatives it put in place prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis.

Over the six months to end-June, equity, credit, foreign exchange and interest rate hedges gained €1.2 billion ($1.4 billion) in value versus the year-ago half, contributing €425 million to net income. Over H1 2019, a fall in the fair value of derivatives cost the insurer €789 million.

Axa took steps to minimise the effect of changes in equity prices on its own-funds through the use of hedges back in [2018](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/5574076/axa-tackles-equity-risk). Over the first three months of the year, the insurer said these contributed €621 million to income alone.

Overall net income for H1 2020 amounted to €1.4 billion, meaning the derivatives gains made up 30% of the total. In 2019 as a whole, changes in the fair value of hedging derivatives cost the insurer €960 million. Net income for the year was €3.9 bbillion

### What is it?

Changes to the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 flow through into profit and loss.

### Why it matters

A hefty portion of Axa’s solvency requirement is driven by [market risk](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7540026/covid-19-chaos-drains-axas-solvency-ii-ratio), meaning sudden moves in asset prices could erode its buffer of own funds, restricting its ability to deploy capital. Recognising this, the firm loaded up on equity puts in early 2018, so that any increase to its solvency requirement caused by falling share prices would be contained.

When indexes stormed higher in 2019, these hedges lost value as their underlying equity portfolios surged. But when the coronavirus pandemic hit, stocks tumbled, and the mark-to-market value of the puts rocketed, helping Axa ride out the chaos. Without the hedges, and those guarding against interest and credit risk, the firm’s first half losses could have been almost a third larger, and its [Solvency II ratio](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7664856/axas-solvency-ratio-continues-fall-in-q2) may have dropped further than it did.
