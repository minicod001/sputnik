{{< quote steelblue >}}_Singapore’s banks hope move will ease margin funding burdens, and speed direct membership_{{< /quote >}}

LCH says it will start accepting Singapore-dollar denominated bonds as collateral by the end of the year. The country’s banks have welcomed the move, saying it will hopefully ease margin funding burdens and make membership of the London-based CCP more attractive.

Singapore’s banks have long [called for](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/5336576/clearing-surge-raises-concerns-of-eligible-collateral-availability) US and European central counterparties to accept a broader range of local currency securities as collateral, with many arguing they are disadvantaged by the extra funding costs associated with having to access dollar, euro and yen repo markets to meet margin payments on trades – something that can be operationally more difficult outside Asia-Pacific trading hours.

“The ability to post Singapore dollars is an advantage, rather than having to raise US dollars,” says Frederick Shen, head of global treasury at OCBC, Singapore’s second largest bank by assets. “The liquidity in the after-hours market and the convertibility of SGD to USD – or other liquid currencies like the euro or sterling – after-hours was an issue before, and it seems it may not be now. When Asian markets are closed, LCH is still open London time.”

The clamour has been growing amid the move to mandatory posting of initial margin (IM) on non-cleared trades. DBS, Singapore’s largest bank, had to [start posting IM](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7531946/initial-margin-delay-disadvantages-dbs) in September 2019; OCBC and UOB were supposed to [start posting IM](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7531946/initial-margin-delay-disadvantages-dbs) this September, but this has now been pushed back until September 2021.

Rohit Verma, head of OTC clearing for Asia at Citi, says it is “heartening” to see CCPs address demand for a broader range of collateral types as initial margin. He reports “sizeable demand” among Citi’s clients to post securities denominated in Asian currencies, particularly Singapore dollar, Australian dollar and yen.

As Risk.net [reported](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7265421/singapores-banks-eye-lch-membership) at the end of last year, Singapore’s largest banks are increasingly keen to become members of LCH’s SwapClear, rather than clearing as clients of larger US and European banks. LCH’s latest move may make the direct clearing model more attractive, says Andrew Ng, head of treasury and markets for DBS.

“This is still in discussion, but if [LCH] is willing to take Singapore dollar as collateral then probably we [will] consider it,” says Ng. “This is definitely good for Singapore’s banks, because our natural deposits are in Singapore dollars. In the past, you either had the extra cost of switching your SGD into USD, or you had a very big USD franchise,” he adds.

Ng sees LCH’s move as a testament to the strength of Singapore’s sovereign bond market, indicating the CCP is comfortable it is deep enough to support liquidation of large amounts of collateral quickly should it be needed in a default scenario.

“In the past, people kept saying the Singapore bond market is not deep enough and there is not so much liquidity, so they couldn’t rely on Singapore securities if they needed to realise the collateral,” says Ng. “We kept saying the Singapore bond market is liquid and deep enough, so I’m glad this is finally being accepted.”

But introducing systems to support Singapore collateral hasn’t been easy for the UK clearing house, says Kate Birchall, the clearer’s head of the Asia-Pacific region, which has been growing its Apac presence but still retains most of its core infrastructure elsewhere.

“Most of the banking services we use are in either the UK or the US, so we have had to think about how we could adapt our systems for Asian currencies,” says Birchall. “This has been a bit of a challenge for us because of the time zone difference.”

LCH also had to work closely with the Bank of England, its home regulator, to make sure it was comfortable with how acceptance of Singapore dollar collateral was being implemented.

Singapore dollar bonds are now the third Apac currency-denominated collateral that LCH accepts. It started accepting Australian-dollar denominated securities in 2016 and Australian dollar cash in 2017, and has long accepted yen collateral too.

“Over the next few years, there will be increasing flexibility in terms of currencies that we offer for margining purposes,” says Birchall.

Birchall suggests one possibility could be the Hong Kong dollar, with LCH keen to win more business from Chinese entities. In June last year, Bank of China (UK) became LCH’s first Chinese bank clearing member.

The ultimate prize for some regional lenders would be for LCH to start accepting Chinese renminbi as collateral.

“I think a lot of banks in Asia – as well as central banks and sovereign funds – have RMB as part of their reserve or part of their investments, so if we could use RMB as collateral that would be really helpful,” says Ng. “That is probably quite a bit further off – but you never know.”
