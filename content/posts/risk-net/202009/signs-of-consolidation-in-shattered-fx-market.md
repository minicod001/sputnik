{{< quote steelblue >}}_Winners of this year’s e-FX Awards discuss shifting strategy among multi-dealer platforms_{{< /quote >}}

Cosmologists call it the ‘Big Crunch’ – a calamitous end for the universe, in which gravitational forces slow and eventually reverse its expansion, causing space to collapse in on itself.

The theory has been largely discredited in recent decades, but scientists might want to pass their research notes to participants in foreign exchange markets. After years in which trading had fragmented across an ever-greater number of venues, there are signs the market may have reached a turning point, with consolidation becoming a bigger strategic focus for some platforms.

“Consolidation and fragmentation are not mutually exclusive states of the world,” says Ken Monahan, a senior analyst at Greenwich Associates. “It’s sort of conventional wisdom that it is easier for small firms to innovate than large ones, and so what you’re likely to see is new firms formed because of relatively low start-up costs, and then the better of these acquired by the market leaders and incorporated into them in parallel with the internal development efforts of the larger firms.”

This year’s e-FX Awards provided fresh evidence of both storylines (see the full list of winners [here](https://www.fx-markets.com/awards/7675286/e-fx-awards-2020-the-winners)). On the one hand, new venues – with new ideas – are taking a run at the world’s biggest financial market. On the other, existing players are trying to counter some of the downsides of fragmentation by bringing more instruments onto their platforms, or reducing the costs borne by liquidity providers.

Over the past 18 months, banks have begun [pushing back against brokerage fees](https://www.fx-markets.com/infrastructure/7519116/fee-fight-dealers-take-aim-at-brokerage-costs) and threatening to cut ties with platforms altogether.

Citi, the most prominent voice in the debate, initially reviewed 53 spot FX platforms [before disconnecting](https://www.fx-markets.com/tech-and-data/7652691/citi-to-focus-on-just-five-fx-spot-platforms) from 20 of them. Another 15 platforms are on the chopping block.

“The margins have been squeezed out of this,” says Mark Suter, chief executive officer at Digital Vega. “When you look at the sort of brokerage fees some venues still charge, and what the voice brokers are still charging, it makes no economic sense anymore. So, you either adapt or you get kicked out.”

### Profit-boosting

This adaptation is showing up in different ways.

At Singapore Exchange, the focus is on offering more products under one roof, theoretically reducing the customer’s need to go elsewhere. In July, SGX snapped up the remaining 80% stake in the BidFX platform as part of a strategy to make both futures and over-the-counter instruments available in a single venue. BidFX brought a client base of more than 100 large global banks, hedge funds and asset managers to the exchange’s FX futures franchise.

KC Lam, head of rates and FX at SGX, says the future of currency trading lies in participants being able to benefit from price discovery, liquidity and transparency in both the OTC and listed futures market “across a contiguous platform”.

He estimates exchange-traded FX accounts for less than 5% of the OTC market, but says there is room for further growth should the market latch on to trading flexible futures. SGX launched its FlexC FX futures product in 2019, enabling clients to trade customisable futures in an OTC fashion and clear the transactions with SGX.

For Digital Vega’s Suter, the emphasis is on reducing the costs that liquidity providers bear, and trying to provide more value. The way he sees it, banks have been giving their liquidity away too cheaply, and will inevitably become more choosy as they attempt to cut costs.

“In the cash markets, it’s been commoditised, and to a certain extent now clients are getting a better experience and have better liquidity than the banks themselves,” says Suter. “Now, everybody’s got the ability to monitor the cost and also monitor the value of the flow. So, you notice, hold on, we’re not making money out of this, why are we doing this? Or when it goes wrong, we have to pick up the bill. So, this is something that’s long overdue.”

Suter aims to capitalise on this shift by tackling the issue of platform fees head-on. In October, Digital Vega plans to launch a fully electronic order book for FX options that emulates how voice brokers trade in the market and, Suter says, will have the added benefits of transparency, reporting and straight-through processing. The most striking feature of the upcoming offering is that Digital Vega will pay participants who add liquidity to the order book rather than the other way around.

The offering could be a boon in emerging market FX options, where some banks are paying up to $30 per million to voice brokers when trading, Suter claims. The platform’s aim is to reduce bank brokerage costs by as much as 75%.

Additionally – following a similar rationale to SGX – Digital Vega is also looking into teaming up with another platform to create a broader service, potentially adding spot, forwards and other instruments to its existing strength in options. The firm has already been approached by a number of potential investors.

“There are lots of cash platforms or spot platforms looking to sell something different because they’ve hit their capacity,” Suter says.

### Friends of fragmentation

While evidence of market consolidation piles up, the forces that created fragmentation in the first place are still alive and kicking. This has given rise to firms like Avelacom and FX HedgePool – the former a connectivity provider, and the latter a peer-to-peer service for currency swaps.

Alina Karpichenko, business development manager at Avelacom, says the firm is betting on renewed interest in emerging markets and is working to create low-latency routes to connect financial firms to those markets.

“Clients need to find new markets and new arbitrage opportunities, which is why they need to set up and start trading on new exchanges,” she says. “We really believe that the interest of financial firms towards emerging markets will be growing and we see a lot of potential in the Middle East, in Latin America and in Asia.”

Karpichenko highlights the number of firms that [have recently answered](https://www.fx-markets.com/tech-and-data/7554401/deutsche-bank-to-launch-e-fx-pricing-engine-in-singapore) Singapore’s call to set up trading engines in the city-state as a case in point.

“With those new pricing and matching engines in Singapore that all those big banks have announced to set up, it means more proprietary traders will be attracted to this market,” she says. “It is kind of an organic development of this ecosystem, because if all those big names set up in Singapore, other companies will be interested in allocating and deploying their IT infrastructure in Singapore as well.”

New opportunities also come from more established, albeit often unsuccessful, market practices, namely peer-to-peer trading. FX HedgePool is the latest hopeful seeking to challenge the status quo and promising big savings for participants.

The firm launched its P2P platform in January, with Jay Moore, founder and chief executive, claiming matching has allowed clients to reduce their trading costs paid on every single roll, from a typical 0.50 basis points to [0.20bp per trade](https://www.fx-markets.com/infrastructure/7663366/swaps-platform-aims-to-cut-out-the-banks-but-not-entirely).

### Cost is contentious

If innovation and low start-up costs are the forces that have produced this vast galaxy of platforms and venues, then cost-cutting is often cited as an argument to collapse it all together.

Large banks pay hundreds of millions of dollars a year to create and maintain a presence on dozens of multi-dealer platforms – in FX and beyond – while the margins on electronic business are being compressed.

Not everyone sees platform fees as the problem.

Carlo Kölzer, chief executive officer of 360T and global head of FX at Deutsche Börse, says brokerage levels are not particularly high and describes the call for lower fees as a cyclical phenomenon.

“When firms are trying to reduce costs, it’s not exactly surprising that the topic of brokerage tends to suddenly pop up,” says Kölzer. “But in our experience, this tends to be cyclical; there are some periods when we seem to be having discussions around this all the time, and then other periods where it’s brought up a lot less. I think that’s the nature of the beast.”

In his view, the answer lies in the source of the value platforms offer their clients, whether that’s better price discovery, whizzy analytics tools, audit and reporting support, or an environment that is consistent with their compliance requirements and internal best practices.

“The reality is they need to cater to the needs of each specifically, and once a platform provider is able to do this, that’s when the magic happens,” he says. “It’s inefficient for these firms to be connected to lots and lots of different FX platforms, so there’s value for them in a provider that can offer them one interface, one analytics tool, one contact person, one API, etc, that then allows them to interact with all of these different market participants.”

That’s another form of consolidation, of course. And big, established platforms like 360T and Euronext FX believe they can be the beneficiaries of it.

Kevin Wolf, chief executive officer of Euronext FX, says: “We tend to think about it in terms of giving the participants the best trading experience possible. If we stop providing good service, our customers will flee, regardless of the brokerage.”

Wolf also argues that the market is more diverse than it might look – the complexity of the market structure allowing people to compete on a number of elements ranging from speed to quality of liquidity, and from data to customisation of order types, just to name a few.

“It might appear commoditised and like there’s a bunch of firms offering the same thing. But everyone’s taking a different approach,” Wolf says. “This market is very varied. I think each platform has a different vision of where they think the market is going and thus focuses on different ways to grow their businesses.”
