Foreign exchange liquidity providers are split over whether to follow in Citi’s footsteps and trim the number of platforms they connect to. While some dealers are looking to cut down on connections, others say they will continue to offer liquidity where clients want to trade.

“We can be firm in saying that this is not a strategy we will be following. Given our technology and analytics capabilities, our approach is to meet clients where they want to meet us,” says Ciara Quinlan, head of electronic principal trading at UBS.

Citi has been vocal about its plans to reduce the number of platforms it connects to, telling FX Markets [in July](https://www.fx-markets.com/tech-and-data/7652691/citi-to-focus-on-just-five-fx-spot-platforms) that it intends to do 90% of volumes through only five venues. The bank cites the build-up of fees and costs that comes from connecting to many platforms, as well as the lack of value that some liquidity-recycling venues bring to the market.

Some dealers are looking to follow the US bank’s lead. Rig Karkhanis, deputy head of global markets at Nomura, says it plans to withdraw from certain electronic communications networks (ECNs) and focus on best-in-class venues.

“We are going to concentrate on a few big ECNs where clients use them actively, but also very much focus on Nomura’s single-dealer platform. Personally, I think that’s everyone’s strategy. It’s a bit of a no-brainer,” says Karkhanis.

“It doesn’t make sense for there to be that many platforms on the market. There will be consolidation and that is already happening. And we see that in terms of client preferences, so that is a theme that we will also follow,” he adds.

Ian Daniels, head of e-FX distribution for Europe and the Middle East at Nomura, says that when making its decisions, the bank will look at how much value a platform adds to its business, the level of engagement it has with the bank, and how forthcoming it is with information about the activities on its platform.

Despite spreads continuing to compress in currency markets, Daniels says the fees that banks are being charged by the platforms are not budging in many cases. He estimates trading costs could be cut by at least 30% if some of those fees could be eliminated.

“It can be to the point where it’s actually costing you to do business. So that’s not commercially viable, and the business we run needs to be commercially viable,” says Daniels.

“The platforms need to take a look at their brokerage costs and start to be a bit more flexible in approach. I think that will happen and people will be forced to do that.”

He says brokerage fees have also become an issue for clients in the wake of the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which introduced a requirement for European asset managers to prove they are achieving best execution for clients.

Others are also starting to look more closely at which platforms clients use. In August, for instance, Naoto Nakamura, global head of FX and local markets trading at MUFG, told FX Markets that the bank is [undertaking an analysis](https://www.fx-markets.com/trading/7668346/mufg-covid-response-could-spur-e-fx-shift-in-japan) of the spot trading platforms it deals with to see which are important for clients.

This campaign appears to be having an effect. Speaking to FX Markets in February, multiple dealers [claimed](https://www.fx-markets.com/infrastructure/7519116/fee-fight-dealers-take-aim-at-brokerage-costs) they had been able to secure lower fees. Strategy is also shifting, as some platforms conclude that years of fragmentation has [run its course](https://www.fx-markets.com/infrastructure/7680031/signs-of-consolidation-in-shattered-fx-market) and the market now needs to consolidate.

### Multiple choice

Not all banks agree that fewer is better, though. UBS says it has the technology to enable connections to multiple platforms while keeping a lid on costs.

“We always analyse profitability and take all costs into account. Our tech set-up makes it easy for us to extend and flex to multiple venues, so it’s not as expensive for us to run such a strategy. In terms of how we view clients and meeting their needs, we’re very happy to keep meeting them on the venue of their choice,” says UBS’s Quinlan.

Mauricio Sada-Paz, global head of e-fixed income, currencies and commodities product and distribution at Barclays, says liquidity providers should be wary of connecting to fewer than 15 venues because this could reduce competition, and give a handful of venues too much pricing power.

“It’s a double-edged sword. Because then you end up with what is currently occurring in fixed income where they have a lot of pricing power, and electronification is squeezing margins and requiring a lot of investment with more automation,” says Sada-Paz.

“You wouldn’t want that to happen in FX. In FX, it’s very fragmented, and that has benefits because there is competition and the discussion can be more balanced between banks and venues,” he adds.

Sada-Paz says that for a while Barclays was concentrating on its single-dealer platform, but it is now striking a balance by engaging more multi-dealer venues and working with connectivity providers.

“One of the things that we’ve decided is that we wanted to partner with the best-in-class on helping us connect to the different venues in order to reduce our cost. And that’s where we teamed up with a low-latency tech provider to help us with Barx Direct connectivity, distribution and matching. So, it’s all about reducing costs and helping clients. Rather than saying, ‘No, I won’t price you there’, we are looking at the cheapest way to connect,” he says.

Some liquidity provider sources argue that certain platforms can continue charging exorbitant fees because they have a loyal corporate client base that is reluctant to change vendors owing to the switching costs involved. This means a big firm like Citi is best placed to take a different approach because of the size of its core franchise, whereas smaller firms don’t have that luxury.

Danske Bank, for instance, is looking to increase its connections from five to 10 venues in order to give a boost to its FX business. Troels Estrup, head of e-commerce currencies and liquidity at Danske Bank, says a liquidity provider of its size still needs to respect client choice, even though it is getting harder to make money in FX.

“Sophisticated clients would rather trade on a multi-bank portal than on Danske’s single-dealer platform, and I understand that. So, I can’t really negotiate with them in a way. We can’t really compare in any sense,” Estrup says.

“Do I think the fees are too high? Yes, absolutely. Can I do much about it? Not really. I’ll leave that to Citi and the tier one banks to fight for,” he adds.
