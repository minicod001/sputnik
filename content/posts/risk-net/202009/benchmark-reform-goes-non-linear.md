Vladimir Piterbarg examines the impact of interest rate benchmark reform and the upcoming Libor transition on options markets. This article addresses the various modelling challenges the transition brings, with a specific focus on the impact on swaptions of the clearing houses’ discounting switch, and on the consequences of Libor transition for Libor-in-arrears swaps, caps and range accruals as typical representatives of a very wide range of Libor derivatives

Interest rate benchmark reform is currently a focus of intense attention for market participants, especially in the areas of proposed fallbacks and their impact on bilateral trading (Henrard [[2020](#bib.bib7)](#bib.bib5)), pre-cessation triggers, discounting changes by central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs), impact on cash versus derivatives markets, as well as many others, primarily in linear markets. The potential impact of the reform on non-linear markets has received less attention (with the notable exception of Orgler & Piterbarg ([[2020](#bib.bib7)](#bib.bib5)), in which Libor reform issues for structured notes were considered). In this article we aim to close this gap by discussing the significant challenges posed by certain non-linear product types and how those challenges could be overcome.

We stress that market developments in the rate benchmark reform space come at a rapid pace, and while the information here is believed to be accurate at the time of writing, some very recent developments may not be reflected in the article’s content. Piterbarg ([2020](#bib.bib9)) (the online version of this article) may include more up-to-date information.
