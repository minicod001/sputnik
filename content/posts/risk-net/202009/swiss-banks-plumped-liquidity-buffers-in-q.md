Credit Suisse and UBS massively expanded their liquidity portfolios over Q2, as they raced to build an adequate funding cushion to ride out coronavirus-induced economic shocks. Because of a [temporary easing](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7532296/finma-relief-unlocks-90bn-of-leverage-exposure-at-credit-suisse) of their leverage-based requirements, though, this growth did not lead to a simultaneous increase to their regulatory capital minimums.

Credit Suisse said its high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), made up of central bank deposits and sovereign bonds, averaged Sfr 203 billion ($222.6 billion) in Q2, up 26% on the prior quarter, while UBS’s surged 21% to $207 billion.

The build up of easy-to-sell assets pushed Credit Suisse’s [liquidity coverage ratio](https://www.risk.net/topics/liquidity-coverage-ratio-lcr) (LCR) up 14 percentage points over the quarter to 196%, and UBS’s 16pp to 155%.

Usually, an increase in total balance sheet assets without a commensurate rise in capital would cause a bank’s leverage ratio to fall. However, both Swiss banks saw their leverage ratios edge higher over the quarter, in part because Finma, their supervisor, told them they could deduct central bank deposits from their leverage exposure measures.

Credit Suisse excluded some Sfr 100.5 billion in Q2 and UBS $89.2 billion using this relief – equal to 12% and 10% of total exposures, respectively. Credit Suisse’s leverage ratio averaged 6.2% in Q2, and UBS’s 6.6%

### What is it?

The LCR is one of two liquidity ratios introduced by the Basel Committee in the wake of the financial crisis.

It requires banks to maintain a sufficient stock of liquid assets – HQLA – to cover projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period of stress.

### Why it matters

Typically, banks have to navigate a trade-off between their leverage and liquidity ratios. If the liquidity portfolio grows too large, then leverage capital requirements start to bite. If it shrinks too much, though, then the LCR could fall close to the regulatory minimum.

Because of Finma’s temporary relief, however, Credit Suisse and UBS can defer this balancing act at least until January 1, 2021, when it expires. Effectively the banks face no capital constraint from loading up on central bank deposits, freeing these resources to underwrite loans and back trading activities.

This is helpful in the midst of the present economic crisis, but since the relief is time-limited, it’s unlikely either bank will alter their portfolio that much by stampeding into high-risk assets.
