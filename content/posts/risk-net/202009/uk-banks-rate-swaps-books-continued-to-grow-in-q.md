The interest rate swap portfolios of UK dealers continued to grow over the second quarter, though their exposure to other types of derivatives fell back, [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-financial-derivative-positions-of-banks-at-market-values-data) data shows.

The total fair value of derivatives assets and liabilities held by UK banks fell 11% to £7.07 trillion ($9.39 trillion) over the three months to end-June. However, interest rate swap exposures defied the overall trend by climbing over 3% to £4.42 trillion. Over Q1, gross interest rate swap derivatives increased a whopping 54%.

In contrast, interest rate options exposures increased by less than half a percentage point to £491.1 billion over Q2, after rising 54% in Q1. Rate futures and forwards exposures fell over the quarter, as did derivatives exposures for all other asset types.

Gross foreign exchange futures and forwards exposures fell the most of all derivatives types over Q2 in sterling terms, by –£381.3 billion to £535 billion, a 42% drop.

### What is it? 

The [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/tables) publishes quarterly statistics on the derivatives positions of UK resident banks, meaning data from foreign-owned banks in the country are included but that from foreign-based branches of UK banks are excluded.

The data is broken down by asset class and counterparty type, with end-quarter derivatives positions recorded at market value or, where this is not available, fair value.

The statistics are gathered through a specialist derivatives survey, known as Form D-Q.

### Why it matters

Unprecedented volatility unleashed by the coronavirus crisis saw traders of all stripes pile into short-term derivatives trades to hedge or speculate on sudden movements in currency, equity, credit and rates.

Then, central banks on both sides of the Atlantic pulled out all the stops to stabilise markets. Their actions put a halt to the wild swings in foreign exchange rates, helped close credit spreads and stabilised equity markets. This likely explains why UK banks’ options and futures exposures pulled back over the second quarter. Once traders’ rash of short-term bets on volatility matured, they declined to put on new ones, as the gains achievable through these instruments aren’t as attractive in the lower-vol environment.

However, interest swap volumes aren’t driven by short-term traders, but by long-term rates forecasts and big institutions’ hedging needs.

The first quarter surge in swaps exposures likely reflects how the market value of existing receive-fixed trades increased dramatically as central banks cut their base rates in Q1. Their ongoing rise in Q2 may be a product of client demand for new swaps, which has increased as top investors have looked to restructure their fixed income portfolios for the new normal and corporates have sought hedges for bonds newly issued to take advantage of rock-bottom rates.
