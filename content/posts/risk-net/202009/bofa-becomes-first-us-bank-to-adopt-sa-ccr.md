{{< quote steelblue >}}_Move cut leverage exposure by $66bn, but other banks wary of trade-offs_{{< /quote >}}

Bank of America has switched to a new leverage regime 18 months before US banks are required to move, dramatically cutting its total exposure – but finding itself alone among its domestic rivals.

BofA is expected to use the move to the standardised approach to counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR) as a springboard for its equity prime brokerage business, which consumes less capital under the new rules. Options market-makers have also welcomed the switch, believing they will be more attractive clients for BofA’s clearing franchise.

So far, other banks appear unwilling to accept the trade-offs in the switch, which reduces capital consumption for some businesses, while raising it for others

“I don’t understand why anyone would want to do that early,” says the head of clearing at a large US bank. “From the numbers we look at [we] will be hit pretty hard by SA-CCR. It was supposed to be favourable for us; it’s actually going to be neutral to slightly negative.”

A risk officer at one options market-maker agrees the mixed impact is deterring wider adoption.

“Sometimes I hear banks say: ‘There are activities within the bank where this is not necessarily better [for capital requirements]’ – then, it becomes difficult to move the whole bank,” he says.

Across the industry, the adoption of the new approach “is going slower than we would have liked,” he adds.

SA-CCR replaces the decades-old current exposure method (CEM) – a framework that many have argued fails to appropriately account [for offsets](https://www.risk.net/regulation/7530856/leverage-ratio-squeeze-hits-options-trades) within portfolios of derivatives products, particularly options trades – a key component of the leverage ratio calculation.

US regulators allowed banks to implement SA-CCR early, ahead of a US Federal Reserve deadline of January 1, 2022. Their European rivals will switch to SA-CCR in mid-2021, but cannot move beforehand – a restriction some [have lamented](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7427951/eu-banks-rue-sa-ccr-mismatch-with-us).

BofA’s adoption of SA-CCR on June 30 [decreased](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7667976/systemic-us-banks-leverage-exposures-shrank-14tn-in-q2) the firm’s risk-weighted assets by $15 billion, and total exposure by $66 billion, according to a spokesperson.

The benefits are not spread evenly across business lines within the bank, however; risk-weighted assets are understood to have increased for BofA’s clearing division as a whole with the implementation of SA-CCR. While the over-the-counter clearing business is said to have roughly the same capital footprint as it did under CEM, BofA’s large listed clearing business suffered overall, owing to asset managers and insurers with big [directional portfolios](https://www.risk.net/regulation/5307456/repeal-cem-reform-sa-ccr) contributing to a significant increase in capital requirements.

One of the problems for these businesses is [a 5% floor](https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs279.pdf) in SA-CCR for the risk offset capability of collateral against the potential future exposure (PFE) of a position, meaning every trade will add at least a slice of capital, with larger trades adding more.

With the net impact for BofA positive as a whole, however, the bank’s senior management is understood to have determined the switch was worthwhile. The decision was taken after a [spike in RWAs](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7566911/us-banks-face-capital-hit-from-resurgent-advanced-approaches) caused by the Covid-19 market volatility in March and April prompted a renewed attempt across the industry to reduce balance sheet usage.

SA-CCR should prove a boon to hedge funds and proprietary trading firms that make markets in listed options products, producing less onerous capital requirements for their clearing firms and freeing up capacity, ensuring firms don’t have to pull liquidity when breaching counterparty limits – a situation that has the potential to exacerbate market falls and spread contagion into underlying equity markets.

Bank of America is one of the largest clearers for options market-makers in the US, with sources putting its share at as much as a third of the market, roughly on par with that of rival Goldman Sachs.

It is understood BofA is not planning to use the switch as a springboard to woo more prop business, however; instead, the bank is looking to double down on winning a greater share of equity prime brokerage accounts, which also look less capital intensive under SA-CCR.

Since April, US equity markets have roared ahead, erasing the losses they saw during early lockdown to enter growth territory for the year. That in turn has bolstered US equity options trading, with clearing house OCC announcing its third-busiest month on record in August. Year-to-date, average daily trading volumes across US options markets are up by almost half, at 28 million contracts per day.

US regulators’ decision to allow US banks to move to SA-CCR early has [frustrated some EU banks](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7427951/eu-banks-rue-sa-ccr-mismatch-with-us) that would like to do the same, with several complaining the discrepancy could give rise to an unlevel playing field.

ABN Amro is one firm that could suffer from a competitive disadvantage if more of its US competitors switch: the Dutch bank is the major clearer for prop shops in Europe and Asia, with some market share in the US, too.

### CEM gripes

Market-makers’ longstanding bugbear with CEM is that it doesn’t allow netting of exposures that offset one other. For instance, call spreads – a common options strategy for betting on a rise in a stock’s value – require an investor to buy a call option from a market-maker at a strike price above current market value and sell back a call option at a still-higher strike price. The investor’s upside is capped, but the overall cost of the trade is reduced.

Under CEM, both positions count towards the market-maker’s current exposure – even though, in reality, the maximum loss is the difference between the two strike prices.

Such vagaries lead to clearing banks either charging options market-makers more for clearing upfront or setting hard limits on the amount of exposure they can clear. These measures can be particularly restrictive to proprietary trading firms during [volatile periods](https://www.risk.net/risk-management/7506216/coronavirus-rout-revives-attacks-on-futures-margining), as changes in the price of options lead to positions being shifted with new strike ranges, inflating their exposure.

The senior risk officer also complains CEM effectively meant proprietary trading firms have been unable to grow their options market-making business.

He and another senior FCM expert doubt, however, that many proprietary trading firms will switch from their current clearing provider to Bank of America purely for “a short-lived advantage” post the bank’s switch to SA-CCR.

Conversely, a separate source at a large FCM notes that banks that remain on CEM for longer can capitalise on advantages against peers that switch early in other product segments which SA-CCR penalises, such as large directional trades.

An in-depth look at how the switch to SA-CCR will impact the clearing business will be published shortly by Risk.net.
