Euronext FX quietly launched a platform for non-deliverable forwards in Singapore and matched its first NDF trade at the end of August, signalling the latest push by currency markets participants to expand digital and automated trading capabilities to a segment of the market that previously lacked it.

The introduction of NDF trading is Euronext FX’s first foray into derivatives products. Trading on the venue will initially focus on one-month tenors in the top Asian currency pairs – Chinese renminbi, Indonesian rupiah, Indian rupee, Korean won, Philippine peso and Taiwanese dollar – as well as the Russian rouble. But Kevin Wolf, chief executive of Euronext FX, says there is the ability to offer different structures, tenors and broken dates based on client demand and how the NDF market develops.

The principles behind Euronext’s wholesale spot FX platforms are being applied to power the NDF offering in Singapore, ensuring that clients have the same functionality and technology as it offers in the spot market. For instance, it will allow firm and last look pricing, as well as disclosed and anonymous trading. For the latter, it will offer post-trade tagging and work with customers to build customised liquidity pools.

Other key features include algorithmic execution and sponsored access. A [range of order types](https://www.fx-markets.com/foreign-exchange/trading/2456194/fastmatch-to-launch-new-order-type-in-may) will be available, including pegged orders and icebergs.

“We’re launching an extension of our current model, which is to work with market participants to customise liquidity that both price makers and price takers will see and interact with. So that definitely sets it apart from traditional central limit order book-type trading,” Wolf says.

Euronext will also employ its flexible matching technique to rank liquidity providers on the NDF platform, a method that ensures quotes are positioned based on the performance of the liquidity providers, not just who has the best price or biggest size available.

“Liquidity providers who perform better in terms of fill rates and hold times will essentially be ranked higher than the providers whose performance is not as strong as the others,” Wolf says.

“It’s an important element of what we do in spot, which is being extended to NDFs.”

The move is the latest change in the fast-evolving NDF market infrastructure. [In August](https://www.fx-markets.com/tech-and-data/7671266/barclays-targets-internalisation-with-new-ndf-algos), Barclays became the fourth bank to offer a suite of NDF algos in the hope of capitalising on the increasing electronification of the asset class, with HSBC following suit shortly after.

Wolf expects many of the early adopters of the NDF offering to be firms that are already actively trading on the spot venue. The firm says it is onboarding a number of global banks, proprietary trading firms and hedge funds to the platform.

Clients will also have access to customised market data based on the counterparties they trade with.

“We can be flexible in how we send market data. Some people want to see it aggregated, some people want to see every quote identified separately, even if it’s at the same price, some people want to see the full stack, some people only want to see the top ‘x’ number of levels. That customised market data model will extend to this as well,” he says.

Although all matching on the NDF platform will take place in Singapore, firms can connect to other datacentres in New York, London and Tokyo. Those orders will be routed to Singapore for local matching.

Euronext is anticipating an expansion in its client base to include US eligible contract participants once its request to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for recognition of equivalency has been granted.

Euronext FX trades an average daily volume of nearly $20 billion in the spot market. It became the first electronic communication network to establish a matching engine in Singapore in September 2019, two years after the MAS outlined an initiative to turn the city state into a global e-FX trading hub. The firm conducted its first spot trade in Singapore that same month.

Average daily NDF trading has nearly doubled over the past three years to $258 billion, according to the Bank for International Settlements’ 2019 FX survey.
