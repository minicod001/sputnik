First-half trading against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic shaped top UK dealers’ credit derivatives portfolios in very different ways.

Barclays led rivals HSBC, Standard Chartered, Natwest and Lloyds in growing the notional size of its credit derivatives portfolio the most over the six months to end-June, by 8% to £800.5 billion ($1.03 trillion). Index credit default swap (CDS) notionals accounted for 53% of the first half total, and single-name CDS 43%.

In contrast, the UK dealer with the next-largest credit derivatives book, HSBC, said notionals fell 5% to $329.2 billion over the same period, having already shrunk 16% over the six months to end-December 2019. Index CDS made up 94% of its H1 total.

At both firms, only a fraction of notionals related to hedges for the lenders’ own banking books – $9.9 billion at HSBC and a mere £355 million at Barclays. The remainder was made up of trades conducted on behalf of intermediaries, either to hedge underlying credit exposures or speculate on corporate credit risk.

Standard Chartered, though dwarfed by HSBC and Barclays, saw notional credit derivatives increase 52% to $123.3 billion over H1, the most of any UK bank percentage-wise.

### What is it?
European Union [disclosure rules](https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/1696202/20370623-9400-4b5e-ae22-08e5baf4b841/Final%20report%20on%20the%20Guidelines%20on%20disclosure%20requirements%20under%20Part%20Eight%20of%20Regulation%20575%202013%20(EBA-GL-2016-11).pdf) oblige banks to report their exposure to credit derivatives at least semi-annually. Exposures are supposed to be broken down between notionals bought and sold, and by type of instrument: single-name CDS, index CDS, total return swap, credit option, other. Banks should also detail the amount held to hedge their own credit risks, and those held as an intermediary.

### Why it matters
Credit spreads went haywire as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, as did [demand for credit-linked derivatives.](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7507771/cdx-volumes-roar-upward-on-coronavirus-panic) Barclays and HSBC, as the only two UK banks with sizeable footprints in the market, would have been expected to cater to customer’s elevated appetites for these products.

But only Barclays’ portfolio actually grew over this period, in step with leading [US banks](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7562286/sold-cds-notionals-climbed-16-at-top-us-banks-in-q1). HSBC did not disclose why notionals declined. Part of the movement may be foreign exchange-related. Most CDS are denominated in either dollars or euros, but Barclays reports in sterling, which may have puffed up its notionals.

What is crystal clear, however, is that own-portfolio hedges make up a remarkably tiny fraction of banks’ overall credit derivatives exposures.

It may well be that lenders have [fallen out of love with CDS](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6322621/non-payment-insurance-grows-as-banks-shun-stuttering-cds-market) as insurance against defaults in their banking books. The notional volume of CDS outstanding has declined dramatically over the past decade, leading banks to turn to instruments like non-repayment insurance for protection instead.
