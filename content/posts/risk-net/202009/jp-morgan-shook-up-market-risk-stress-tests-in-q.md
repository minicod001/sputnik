Top US dealers have to use a 12-month period of significant financial stress to calculate part of their market risk capital requirements. Over the second quarter, JP Morgan changed the starting date of its chosen stress period 60 times, having not moved it once over any of the preceding 21 quarters, [regulatory filings](https://www.ffiec.gov/npw/FinancialReport/ReturnFinancialReportPDF?rpt=FFIEC102&id=1039502&dt=20200630) show.

The stressed value-at-risk (SVAR) capital charge, one of the six that make up the market risk requirement for advanced approaches banks, is calculated by running a firm’s trading portfolio through a VAR model populated with market data from an appropriate stress period. Each bank uses a different period that fits the unique makeup of their books.

As of end-June, JP Morgan’s stress period had the starting date April 5, 2019, meaning it encompassed the Covid market shock of February and March this year. Three months prior it was set to June 10, 2008. Banks are permitted to dynamically switch their internal stress periods as their portfolios change, but none of the eight global systemically important banks (G-Sibs) had changed theirs more than 11 times in one quarter before. JP Morgan did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

In Q2, Bank of America changed the starting date of its stress period 21 times, Goldman Sachs eight times, and Citi and BNY Mellon one time each. State Street, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley did not alter their stress periods. Each of these G-Sibs ended the quarter using a stress period straddling 2007–09.

Aggregate SVAR charges across the eight G-Sibs increased 11% over the three months to end-June. Citi’s increased the most percentage-wise, by 37% to $1.1 billion. JP Morgan’s increased less than 3% to $2.1 billion.

### What is it?

Banks subject to US federal agencies’ market risk rule must disclose their capital requirements in quarterly [FFIEC 102](https://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/HCSGreaterThan10B.aspx) reports.

Each bank’s market risk capital requirement includes both a VAR and a stressed VAR component: the former based on a VAR model calibrated to a 99% confidence level over a 10-day holding period and a 12-month observation period; and the latter using the same model fed with historical data from a 12-month period of significant financial stress. The stressed VAR-based measure must be calculated at least weekly.

The rules also state that a bank must have policies and procedures that explain why a chosen stress period is appropriate and describe the process for “selecting, reviewing and updating the period of significant financial stress”.

### Why it matters

The coronavirus-induced market panic led to unprecedented market moves over the second quarter, and huge turnover in top banks’ [trading portfolios](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7667416/citi-goldman-had-most-winning-trading-days-of-top-banks-in-q2), as dealers rushed to fulfil client orders. Both factors could cause a bank to change the stress period used to set its SVAR.

Banks don’t disclose the starting date of each and every stress period used over a three-month period, just the one they end the quarter with, but it’s plausible that other banks beside JP Morgan used periods encompassing the [Covid shock](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7675456/the-long-term-effect-of-covid-19-on-market-risk-capital) at some point over Q2.

Still, it’s noteworthy that only JP Morgan ended the period using an observation window referencing 2020, implying the end-June composition of the other banks’ portfolios would face a tougher time under a redo of the global financial crisis than another bout of coronavirus-inspired volatility.
