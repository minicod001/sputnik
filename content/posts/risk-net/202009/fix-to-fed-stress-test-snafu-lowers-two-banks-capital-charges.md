Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had their binding capital requirements lowered on Friday (September 4) after the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200904a.htm) admitted it fouled-up their [stress test](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7568091/goldman-faces-high-stress-capital-buffer-after-fed-tests) results.

The agency said it botched the projected loss rates for certain “public welfare investments”, an error that inflated projected losses at five of the 11 banks subject to the global market shock component of this year’s Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST): Citi, HSBC North America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. It is understood that public welfare investments are those made by firms to low- and moderate-income communities or families, and include housing and development loans.

In fixing the error, the Fed revised down the stress capital buffer (SCB) requirement for [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/media-relations/press-releases/current/statement-on-stress-capital-buffer-revision.html) to 6.6% from an initial level of 6.7%, and for [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/press-releases/morgan-stanley-announces-revision-to-stress) to 5.7% from 5.9%. The SCBs of the other three banks were unaffected.

The [amended stress test results](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2020-dfast-results-20200625.pdf) show that Goldman’s actual projected trading losses under the global shock scenario were $17.8 billion, compared to the initial amount of $18.4 billion. Morgan Stanley’s losses were revised down to $9.5 billion from $10.1 billion.

Aggregate projected trading losses across the 11 banks subject to the global market shock were lowered to $83 billion from $85 billion.

### What is it?

This year, the DFAST tests pitted US banks and the US holding companies of foreign banking organisations against a baseline and severely adverse stress scenario cooked up by the Fed, the variables of which were released earlier this year. The scenarios last nine quarters.

The Fed estimates the subject banks’ projected revenues and losses under these scenarios, and use the peak-to-trough capital depletion under the Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based measure to size each firms’ SCB.

The new SCB requirement becomes effective as of October 1.

### Why it matters

In fixing its blunder, the Fed has ever-so-slightly loosened the capital constraints for two of Wall Street’s premier trading firms. For Goldman Sachs especially, this is welcome news. Its initial SCB, when added to its other mandatory requirements, produced an all-in CET1 capital requirement equal to 13.7% of standardised risk-weighted assets, above the [13.6%](https://www.goldmansachs.com/media-relations/press-releases/current/pdfs/2020-q2-earnings-results-presentation.pdf) actual ratio it reported for end-June.

Though the bank had always projected it would hurdle the 13.7% minimum in time for the October 1 implementation of the SCB, the Fed’s cut has lowered its CET1 burden by roughly $563 million going on end-June RWA numbers. This may not mean much group-wide, but at a trading desk level it could be meaningful. The excess capital requirement was applied in response to projected trading losses, after all, so it would make sense if the bank applied the ‘savings’ to its dealmaking unit.

As for the Fed, it said it has made changes to prevent similar miscalculations in the future. Still, the incident will do little to reassure those whose faith in the central bank’s stress tests has [already been shaken](https://www.risk.net/investing/regulation/7649621/how-the-feds-covid-stress-test-got-stuck-in-the-middle).
