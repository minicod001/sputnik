{{< quote steelblue >}}_Political wrangles have helped boost FX options volumes in Hong Kong dollar and sterling_{{< /quote >}}

Foreign exchange options markets for sterling and the Hong Kong dollar showed signs of life in recent weeks, as political events spurred activity in the two currencies.

When the US sought to revoke Hong Kong’s special status earlier this year, some speculated that the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the greenback would buckle. Since then, the currency's strength has kept it trading at the bottom end of its range and option traders have increasingly bet that it would breach its floor.

In the UK, Brexit once again took centre stage. Concerns that the country would fail to reach an agreement with the European Union about its future relationship with the bloc sparked activity in what had been a relatively quiet options market so far this year.

Weekly vanilla options trading is visible on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s swap data repository. The data includes trades involving US-regulated firms and offers one of the best publicly available insights into FX options trading.

### Sterling under pressure

The possibility that the UK government would break international law and ignore parts of its withdrawal agreement with the European Union sent sterling lower against the US dollar and increased activity in GBP/USD options.

Figure 1 shows:

- In the 35 weeks leading to September, weekly GBP/USD vanilla options volume averaged $13.1 billion.

- The week ending September 13 was the busiest of the year for GBP/USD option trading, with $24 billion over 816 trades hitting the market.

- However, the volumes paled in comparison to October and December 2019, which coincided with the revised withdrawal agreement clearing its first hurdle in the UK parliament and the country’s general election, respectively.

- Notably, Covid-induced volatility failed to increase cable option volumes as it did for [other currency pairs](https://www.fx-markets.com/trading/7507751/coronavirus-jolts-fx-options-market).

Figure 2 shows:

- September also saw options volatility rise to its highest since April in various tenors.

- Volatility in one-month GBP/USD options peaked at 12.03 on September 11.

- The peaks remained below the highs of last year, which coincided with periods of Brexit-related tensions.

### USD/HKD tests peg’s floor

The Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the US dollar sees it trade freely within a defined range of HK$7.75 and HK$7.85. Options often trade with strike prices outside the band, however, representing a bet that the peg will break down.

The political situation notwithstanding, relatively higher interest rates in Hong Kong have helped increase demand for the currency and forced the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to sell the local currency in order to maintain the peg.

Figure 3 shows:

- USD/HKD has averaged 7.751 since the start of April.

- In 2019 the exchange rate averaged 7.835.

Figure 4 shows:

- Weekly volumes in USD/HKD vanilla options with strikes above the pegged range exceeded those with strikes below in 55 of the past 85 weeks where trading occurred outside the peg, reflecting the strength of the US dollar relative to the Hong Kong dollar.

- The week ending May 31 saw $4.2 billion options traded with strikes outside the peg, 99% of which reflected views that the Hong Kong dollar would appreciate beyond the lower bound. The period was the most active week for trading outside the peg since at least early 2019.

- Since then, roughly two-thirds of weeks with trading outside the peg have seen more option volume with strikes below the peg than above it.

Figure 5 shows:

- The same period saw an increase in quoted volatility across various USD/HKD option tenors.

- Volatility in one-year options peaked during this period at 1.995 on July 30. In late September, volatility remained 61% higher than the January average.
