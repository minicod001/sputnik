The amount of derivatives held by UK banks with cross-border counterparties fell back sharply over the three months to end-June after growing hugely in the first quarter, [Bank of England data](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-financial-derivative-positions-of-banks-at-market-values-data) shows.

As of Q2, the value of gross derivatives – assets plus liabilities – with non-UK banks stood at £2.96 trillion ($3.96 trillion), down almost 9% on Q1. Over the first three months of the year, these portfolios had grown 67%.

Gross swaps trades with non-bank overseas entities shrank even faster, by 23% to £1.25 trillion. In Q1, these books expanded 92%, to their highest level since Q2 2016.

UK banks’ derivatives assets and liabilities also fell slightly over Q2 with UK non-bank financial institutions, UK banks and building societies, and UK non-financial corporations.

Net derivatives assets of UK banks across all counterparties amounted to £63.9 billion as of June, down 4% on Q1.

### What is it? 

The [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/tables) publishes quarterly statistics on the derivatives positions of UK resident banks, meaning data from foreign-owned banks in the country are included but that from foreign-based branches of UK banks are excluded.

The data is broken down by asset class and counterparty type, with end-quarter derivatives positions recorded at market value or, where this is not available, fair value.

The statistics are gathered through a specialist derivatives survey, known as Form D-Q.

### Why it matters

Major dealers reported sharp falls in the value of their derivatives portfolios over Q2, likely driving the UK-wide trend. [HSBC](https://www.risk.net/risk-quantum/7662701/hsbc-trading-unit-hit-by-355m-of-xva-costs-in-h1), for instance, disclosed a drop in derivatives assets of 15% over the quarter to $313.8 billion, from an unusually elevated level in Q1.

The value of banks’ swaps books expanded rapidly that quarter as interest rates plummeted and equity markets tanked. As these markets normalised in Q2, it makes sense that the valuations of the derivatives tracking them also pared back.

It may also have been the case that some clients who rushed to UK dealers for hedges and to speculate on the wild market volatility in Q1 unwound their trades in Q2 as the craziness ebbed.
