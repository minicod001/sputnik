A US technology firm is developing a payments system for foreign exchange trades in emerging market currencies that it hopes will reduce settlement risk.

California-based Baton Systems is working on a series of liquidity management tools that would enable counterparties to make flexible payments to each other, by either splitting them up or making them conditional to certain trigger events.

The system aims to provide near real-time settlement for emerging and frontier currencies, where a lack of liquidity can often make traditional payment-versus-payment (PvP) systems unviable. It uses distributed ledger technology to create a single, shared record of transactions.

One large global bank has been using the Baton Settlement product since the second quarter of 2019 and FX Markets understands that six other banks are currently testing the service.

“Emerging markets is where we are seeing a need for this, especially when you have counterparties that are stronger in certain regional markets,” says Arjun Jayaram, founder and chief executive of Baton. “They can be your primary liquidity providers in certain markets, but because they’re smaller you have a risk element that comes in play, or you have a settlement risk that comes into play. So, you have to manage both liquidity as well as risk.”

Emerging market currencies tend to be less liquid than their developed market peers, creating settlement problems. The currencies can be subject to unpredictable swings in demand, exacerbated by early cut-off times for payments to correspondent banks. In some cases, a payment in one currency that is contingent on a payment in another currency can result in a cash shortage that forces a bank to resort to its swap lines.

Baton is one of a number of tech firms eying the FX post-trade and settlement area, where incumbent CLS Bank has a stranglehold on PvP settlement in major currencies. London-based Cobalt, for example, uses distributed ledger technology for its FX post-trade platform. And R3, a consortium of financial firms, is exploring blockchain and distributed ledgers in its work on smart contracts.

CLS, owned by a pool of the world’s major banks, settles around $5.5 trillion of payments per day on average. Around one-third of the $18.7 trillion-per-day gross payment obligations worldwide are settled using PvP systems, according to the latest Bank for International Settlements [data](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1912x.htm) (see figure 1).

CLS’s primary settlement system works by batching trades, which can lead to a time lag of 48 hours before completion. Baton is plugged directly into a counterparty’s back-office systems and channels payments via its platform, enabling it to settle trades in around three minutes.

Baton’s new service is an extension of its existing real-time settlement platform, which it [launched](https://www.fx-markets.com/technology/market-data/3364431/baton-joins-nex-infinity-as-first-third-party-provider) in conjunction with Nex Group in 2017.

CLS itself recognises a need to improve settlement of emerging market currencies. In July, the utility [said](https://www.fx-markets.com/infrastructure/7661051/cls-proposes-second-tier-fx-settlement-system) it was exploring whether to build a second-tier system to accommodate currencies that are ineligible for its main service.

### Faster payments

Settlement risk occurs when an institution fails to receive the currency bought after paying the currency it has sold. It is a complex problem to solve because it involves trade netting and currency liquidity across multiple jurisdictions.

When counterparties trade, Baton receives a copy of the transactions and continuously nets them on behalf of the members. When each party is ready to settle, Baton instructs both sides to pay into their respective escrow accounts. Once there is confirmation of the funds’ arrival from both sides, Baton then legally changes ownership of the money from the escrow accounts to each parties’ desired destination.

Baton only moves the money from one account to the next after the ownership change is recorded. The firm uses [distributed ledger technology](https://www.fx-markets.com/risk-management/4207716/digital-fx-settlement-volume-tipped-to-rise-tenfold) to record the ownership change of funds and also for its clients to synchronise their activities on the platform. Both parties are able to see the same data and confirm it on the shared ledger before money moves in the real world.

Baton is developing four options for the service. Users will be able to split payments into smaller chunks instead of having to make a lump-sum payment. Baton will also allow counterparties that are not members of the platform to make payments, so long as the facing party is a member.

The firm is also working to put in place threshold- and frequency-based settlements where it will release payments according to the parameters that the parties have agreed to. Alternatively, participants can choose to settle a trade in real time instead of waiting until a threshold or deadline is reached.

From a legal standpoint, the system complies with payment regulations in each country since it uses the bank’s own “payment rails”, Jayaram says.

“We are using the existing message standards and we are communicating to the core ledgers of the banks and therefore we are consistent with the electronic fund transfers in those respective countries which the banks are already using,” he says.

### Getting a handle on risk

FX settlement risk has risen to the fore in recent months as various FX committees discuss a response to the number of emerging market currencies that are ineligible for use at CLS.

At first glance, such a risk appears high. The latest Bank for International Settlements survey found daily gross payment obligations of $18.7 trillion in December 2019, of which $8.9 trillion of FX payments were settled without PvP protection.

According to the BIS, the proportion of PvP trades has fallen from 50% in 2013 to 40% in 2019, a decline driven by an increase in the amount of trades in CLS-eligible currencies settled without PvP and by the growth in non-CLS currencies largely settled outside a PvP structure.

Meanwhile, the share of total turnover for CLS-ineligible currencies has jumped from 14%, or $800 billion, in 2013, to over 18%, or $1.25 trillion, in 2019.

Central bankers and industry experts are trying to get ahead of what they believe could be a potential problem.

At its July meeting, the New York Fed’s FX committee discussed the possibility of strengthening principles 35 and 50 of the FX Global Code related to the management and reduction of FX settlement risk as part of the Global Foreign Exchange Committee’s triennial review of the code.

During the meeting, Lawrence Sweet, a senior vice-president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that “such strengthening could reflect industry perspectives on the challenges and opportunities for increasing the use of PvP when available, and for promoting the appropriate measurement and control of FX settlement risk when PvP is not used”.

Guy Debelle, chair of the Global Foreign Exchange Committee, tells FX Markets that the GFXC is working to determine the extent of settlement risk and what action needs to be taken, and that he welcomes any solution that could help reduce this risk in the market.

### Creativity will win

Richard de Roos, head of foreign exchange at Standard Bank in South Africa, says the introduction of a CLS-type arrangement would have a big impact in frontier markets in Africa such as Angola, where the currency can experience periods of sparse liquidity.

He adds that Standard Bank is interested in using PvP facilities in currencies that are not currently part of CLS. The bank has already been approached by a number of PvP providers – some in their infancy and others looking to operate as a utility with membership – that are working to provide a safe environment for matching to occur.

“There’s a lot of gaps in these markets where I think that creativity is going to win the day in terms of reaching these accounts and currencies,” says de Roos. “With a lot of these currencies, the discretion not to join or be a part of CLS is obviously a cost base issue. So, I do think that whoever can do it efficiently and cheaply, will win the day.”
